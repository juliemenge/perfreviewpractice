Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"- Aaron's design work on data brick was good.

- For data brick, I was able to give him a rough volume to work in, and he went off and designed and gave me a solution inside that volume. He understood the requirements with minimal input from me, and went off and designed something without taking much of my time.

- I frequently used Aaron as a mini design review consultant. I think he and I worked very well together in that respect, and he definitely helped me move the design forward without waiting for one big review to catch issues.

- I believe it was Aaron who caught the biggest oversight in my AVS design, which was the condensation issue. Based on his feedback here, we were able to catch the error in time and get a solution in place on the vehicle.",,,Ryan Davis,rdavis@argo.ai,Aaron Rifkin,arifkin@argo.ai,Hardware,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Aaron worked with me (Josh S), Ryan, and Sri to develop a data brick enclosure that balanced everybody's needs. The mate/unmate design of the data brick worked perfectly the first time, making it easier to debug my PCBA designs.

Aaron also performed a significant amount of work on sensor placement studies for Z2, which consumed the majority of his time. Despite this, Aaron was able to prioritize work such that the data brick mechanicals were completed in time for thermal testing and PCBA arrival.",,,Josh Smith,jsmith@argo.ai,Aaron Rifkin,arifkin@argo.ai,Hardware,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Most of my work with Aaron was on the Z1 mule, sensor bench, and breadboard projects. When working on the Z1 mule project, Aaron did a great job of driving progress forward on the project. He led discussions with several teams at FMC and Argo to clarify the use cases of the Z1 mule, and plan the timeline for the project. Because of this effort early in the project timeline, the team was ultimately able to conclude that we would not be able to get some of the necessary components necessary for the project requirements. This realization led us change the Z1 breadboard plan, and not build a mule vehicle. Although unfortunate, realizing our limitations early saved a lot of time and resources across many individuals at both Argo and FMC. When the team's focus shifted to the sensor benches and breadboard, Aaron was always engaged in our weekly meetings and contributed to the many tasks throughout the project. He was also always willing to review design or presentation materials, and provided honest and useful feedback on designs or presentation materials I was working on.  ",,,Cole Hartman,chartman@argo.ai,Aaron Rifkin,arifkin@argo.ai,Hardware,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Aaron did a great job jumping into the Z2 sensor placement and FoV work.  Starting with lidar and camera positions, he presented good studies of the design space and drove decisions.  He completes good detailed analysis and raises important questions to the team to drive resolution.  

Moving into the role to lead integration efforts for near-field sensing he has effectively led work to reach a plan of record.  He is easy to collaborate with as we work together on sensor integration, and always willing to do whatever work needs to be done to meet deadlines, even if not directly within his responsibilities.  

For Data logger, Aaron held organized design reviews, presenting the design very openly to get feedback from the mechanical team.  
",,,Beth Ballard,eballard@argo.ai,Aaron Rifkin,arifkin@argo.ai,Hardware,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Aaron has served on three primary programs at Argo recently: the sensor bench / breadboard, the Z1 data logger mechanicals, and Z2 sensor integration.

Aaron stepped up to coordinate our Z2 sensor integration plans when we had no one to fill the role. Aaron led a variety of meetings with Sys-Eng, Hardware, Software, and Leadership to help us run through dozens of sensor field of view studies. Aaron also conducted a large number of Blender studies for our field of view research. Aaron also helped coordinate a few major design reviews for sensor integration.",,,Wes Ford,wford@argo.ai,Aaron Rifkin,arifkin@argo.ai,Hardware,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"During the early stages of data brick development, it could have been beneficial to meet with the operations team to discuss their expectations, needs, and wants for the product. Not only will they be the primary end users, but they have experience and opinions about the current solution. Doing this could also help with building priority matrices to aid in time management. ",,,Josh Smith,jsmith@argo.ai,Aaron Rifkin,arifkin@argo.ai,Hardware,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"I'd like to improve my time management. Projects often take longer than I first anticipate.  An example could be the Z1 data logger.  It probably could have been delivered sooner, although it is difficult to manage priorities across several projects.",,,Aaron Rifkin,arifkin@argo.ai,Aaron Rifkin,arifkin@argo.ai,Hardware,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"- For data brick, Aaron could have probably engineered a more compact tightly integrated solution. That being said, I told him to take as much volume as he needed, because I wouldn't likely take the space back based on other needs. The solution he delivered seemed to match the AVS as a whole from a mechanical perspective, probably a bit under-engineered and over-built to ensure very low likelihood of mechanical failure.

- Aaron could have done a better job of uploading data on a more frequent basis (small nitpick, every time I asked for it, Aaron provided updates).

- I have the feeling that the majority of Aarons more influential work is along the lines of sensor placement which I'm much less familiar with.",,,Ryan Davis,rdavis@argo.ai,Aaron Rifkin,arifkin@argo.ai,Hardware,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"In the time Aaron has been at Argo his good work has spoken for itself and he has established himself as a very strong contributor and leader across several projects. I think the best way for Aaron to grow and improve is if he is given additional opportunities, autonomy, and freedom to take actions and make decisions. I think he has the ability to rise to any challenge that is given to him, and it would serve the organization well to feed his development in any way they can.",,,Cole Hartman,chartman@argo.ai,Aaron Rifkin,arifkin@argo.ai,Hardware,

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Transitioning to his role leading near-field sensing integration, Aaron will have opportunities to continue to grow in learning to most effectively drive design direction within Ford.",,,Beth Ballard,eballard@argo.ai,Aaron Rifkin,arifkin@argo.ai,Hardware,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"A few of the projects that Aaron has worked on as have not been delivered with the expediency and thoroughness that Argo Hardware needs from a Senior level engineer. I would have liked to see Aaron take a stronger sense of initiative and drive with managing the sensor bench and bread board programs. Early progress on the program was slow, and planning for electrical design + firmware bringup was incomplete. Progress at Ford and Argo on harnesses languished for months. Aaron should push to marshal cross functional resources to deliver his modules and deliver results faster given our tight deadlines. In the end, we had to pull in TPM resources to help manage the sensor bench / electrical breadboard, and we mostly pulled Aaron off the program. I recognize that the sensor bench / electrical breadboard program had challenges, but all engineering programs have challenges that engineers must push through and solve.

Likewise, the data brick program is far behind schedule even though this is one of the more simple modules in the VDS system. I would expect Aaron to have moved faster to delivering final designs even given the constraints of Aaron receiving his design parameters late. We should have kicked off prototyping for serviceable latching mechanisms earlier rather than beginning testing just a few weeks before the MRD.

On the Z2 sensor integration, I would push Aaron to take a stronger sense of ownership for integrating stereo cameras and radar. I worry that Aaron has been passive at times rather than driving technical requirements definition, design, and validation across the cross functional team. Aaron needs to engage with Ford proactively and facilitate rapid forward progress at Argo and at Ford.

I would love to put Aaron on more challenging and impactful programs at Argo, but first we need to see Aaron deliver higher performing results on his current projects. Aaron is meeting expectations for an L3/4 Mechanical Engineer, but his output is not on par for an Argo L5 Mechanical Engineer. 

I know Aaron has great potential, so we'll continue to work with Aaron to ramp up his output.",,,Wes Ford,wford@argo.ai,Aaron Rifkin,arifkin@argo.ai,Hardware,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"I joined Argo in the middle of January which turned out to be the beginning of Code Red. During my first month I attempted to help out with any testing I could while learning the system on the fly. During my on-boarding period I was able to help out with Argo Camera Testing at Fords Research Facility and I started low level troubleshooting to help the fleet op drivers successfully launch the software.

Once I started to understand the software and the platform more I began to run many types of VTR’s for all groups of the company, mostly focusing on motion planning and motion control. My first Project was to test the M1B HUD lights including AV engagement and disengagement and administer a survey, in this project we identified a few unnecessary changes and one critical disengagement issue.


Some of the areas I help daily in are:

Setting up the operator laptops using the Swanserver for master releases and canary testing. Also ingesting data into the ingest server and troubleshooting when there are issues (this happens quite often).
 
Working with the vehicle coordinators on the current VTR’s and help setting up fleet ops to collect the VTRs, some examples are camera/radar extended manual testing and many mapping challenges. I help by explaining to the operators what they need to collect, how to collect it and by setting them up with special software builds.

I also help out a ton by becoming a Senior Vehicle Operator (SVO) very quickly, I trained with Jake Larry at the track until he approved that I can start to operate on public roads with development builds. This works out extremely nicely as I can drive for Kevin Swanson and he can test his VTR’s and then we can swap positions and I can run my VTR’s. This technique is very time efficient, and we are extremely short SVO’s at the Dearborn location.

Currently I am a Welcome buddy for our newest Test Engineer. I am trying to make sure he gets all the information he needs to start a successful career at Argo. 

Some of my bigger accomplishments thus far:
Car 24 braking issue was a huge project. It took a month running dozens of tests at DDC every time we ruled out a possibility or had a hardware component change. During this investigation, a process for testing the Z0 fleet braking issues was created and multiple problem cars have been identified. Now that we have identified the issue we have created a document for fixing and verifying the braking performance. This process will likely be used while the Z0 fleet still exists. 

When the new “IncrediBuild” building program was launched it was not compatible with a newer laptop that was setup with the docker Overlay2 file system (like my laptop). With the original buildit script not being supported we needed to find a solution. This was not easy as IT told me this was not possible, but by working with the infrastructure team we found a solution that is now currently being used in the on-boarding setup today. 

 Overall I feel I work well on the Dearborn Team and am always willing to put forth the extra effort and hours needed to complete a test. I try to accommodate any requests that I receive for help and will keep  up the effort in the future!",,,Adam Pagryzinski,apagryzinski@argo.ai,Adam Pagryzinski,apagryzinski@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Adam has been a huge asset to the team since he joined. Coming in, he did not have much relevant software experience, but had two important assets of deep testing experience in unpredictable environments, and the urge to jump into every challenge he's given.

From the first day he worked next to me to try to absorb everything that I had been working on. He did a great job of taking notes, learning quickly, and trying to get in the seat himself to get a hands on experience. This enabled him to help support VTRs right off the bat very effectively.

Adam helps with fleet support. Since we don't have many (any) SVOs here to help communicate with our VOs, Adam supports them with any issues and has also taken up getting the fleet running on the right software and helping them debug problems.

Adam has taken a primary role in supporting hardware testing and working with Ford, especially when it comes to Z1 testing. He has worked on the M1B testing, braking testing for Z0, and is now working on the light bar testing. He also works closely with Bryan Barnette to support his integration efforts.

Adam has a great attitude, gets his work done, and is always happy to put in the extra effort too. This consistent extra effort that he displays is why I think he sits above just doing his job. Without him we would not have been able to make nearly as much progress this year as we have. ",,,Kevin Swanson,kswanson@argo.ai,Adam Pagryzinski,apagryzinski@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,,,,Jake Larry,jlarry@argo.ai,Adam Pagryzinski,apagryzinski@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Adam started as a test engineer at Argo shortly after i came to Argo. His contribution to our team from Dearborn in a short time have been critical to our team here in pittsburgh. Some of his contributions are :
* Taking care of vehicle test requests especially those related to Motion control in a timely manner.
* Getting vehicles setup with approved RC from testops to fleetops at Dearborn.
*  Assisting fleetops to do vehicle test requests that require building images, pulling branches etc.
* Getting vehicles setup to come to Pittsburgh/Miami
* Getting infrastructure setup at Dearborn with limited resources.

I have gotten a chance to work with him during the few days he was here which was a  critical time at Argo. We worked together in getting fleetops sync better with all the changes that have happened since last software release. I have noticed that he pays attention to details, is a good communicator and fun to work with. in addition,he is always willing to help Pittsburgh team with work load as well which I really appreciate. 
 

In general, he does a solid job of getting testing done with the limited resources that he has at his location of work.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Working with Adam has been a good experience. He is a Test Engineer but he and I have worked together on a number of VTRs. Adam is a team player. He is willing to work late in order to get some testing done, even if a test is requested late in the evening. Adam is obviously a fast learner, as he got here in January and by March, he was already out performing VTRs on his own. Some of the things that I have worked with Adam on can be seen below:

- M1B PSCM debugging: Even though this ended up being a supplier issue, we still did some work to troubleshoot the hardware.
- Light bar testing: We collected some data for the Z1 light bar design that was applied to a stock fusion. 
- General VTRs: Adam and I worked together on general VTRs that needed to be tested on develop, which required and SVO. 
- Z0 Fleet Brake Regression: Adam and I worked closely with Ford to find a fix for the Z0 Fleet braking issues that we have seen on a few of Argo's vehicles. 
- Adam has been able to find ways to perform multiple VTRs at the same time, which is pretty efficient. 


Adam is a good fit for our team here in Dearborn. I want to see how he will grow within the company. I am sure that we will be working together on a lot of things.  ",,,Bryan Barnette,bbarnette@argo.ai,Adam Pagryzinski,apagryzinski@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"There are lots of areas I can improve on and with time I believe I will. For example:

I still need more Information and background knowledge of Z0, as I move forward with steering torque disengagement research I find that I still have too many questions to be able to isolate the issue and create recommendations. I will rectify this in the future by pushing for more documentation on the issues and having more one on ones with subject matter experts at Argo, this will save lots of time and wasted efficiency. 

One case that I need to improve on in the future will be to create more tickets for the issues I find. Many times I instantly slack the parties that have caused issues, instead of creating traceable tickets that can not be overlooked or forgotten. I will address this by starting to create more tickets that we find, also in the future it will be easier for this to happen as we will have a more open testing facility when our parking lot opens up. With that I can recreate the issue and help narrow down what is exactly happening.",,,Adam Pagryzinski,apagryzinski@argo.ai,Adam Pagryzinski,apagryzinski@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Adam can improve in two areas primarily:
1) He needs to improve documentation - something that he mentioned himself and everyone needs to improve after their first few months here. He has done a great job at learning, now he just needs to improve his reporting to help push the team forward.

2) A little less concrete, but to bump to the next level Adam can take more ownership of his projects. He has been owning the hardware testing in Dearborn in terms of performing the tests, but he can push this to owning the decisions based off of these tests' results.",,,Kevin Swanson,kswanson@argo.ai,Adam Pagryzinski,apagryzinski@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Most of my time since joining Argo in early February has been spent working on the Operator Management tool for the mapping and labeling team. The tool is still very young, but we are working hard toward enabling features in the UI that were originally performed manually via sql scripts or scripted interactions with the service endpoints. One personal key accomplishment in this area is removing the necessity for engineering support when creating jobs. The Job/Task/Session/WorkUnit relationships  are complicated, but the new creation forms simplify the process in a way that allows Operator Management admin users to create any of the supported Job types using the data from the map request tickets. Another useful accomplishment in Operator Management is insight into a Job's progress. The information in the UI outlines the required steps, required time, and an estimate for time to completion. One technical improvement for the front end was the conversion from Javascript to Typescript. Using a typed language will allow for faster and less error-prone implementation as the application scales in size.

While I have been fairly isolated on Operator Management much of the work has involved collaboration with (or at least guidance from) Eddie, who wrote the original backend service and has been a great source of design input. Additionally, as we put more focus on the tool I've had a chance to work with Henry and Ian who have both added various features. I've been able to see the code from some of the other tools via code reviews as well (I was surprised to see that I've reviewed 150+ PRs in my 3 months here).  

Given that I am relatively new here, much of my growth has been centered around the technology stack, culture, and processes of Argo.  From a technological standpoint I've enjoyed learning Typescript, React, Redux, Docker, Docker-Compose, and Marathon.   I have primarily been working in JS/Angular for applications that essentially run in isolation on closed/secure systems for several years so it's been great to learn the other side of the spectrum both from a web-tools and a deployment perspective.  I've also been working in Java/Spring more than I have over the last few years.  My progress is definitely slower there than in the front-end, but I feel I've made significant improvements since I started.  Additionally, even though we are working to remove manual edits for the Operator Management system it still requires a significant level of database interaction.  I've essentially taken over production support for the database, which is time consuming but also provides excellent insight and motivation for what features to add to the UI.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"I have not had sufficient time being employed at ARGO to judge Adam sufficiently but from what I've seen he's been very helpful with systems that he himself was new to. He's picked up domain knowledge of the Operator Management tool very quickly and was able to explain the various systems in a compact and accurate form when I needed to start interacting with them. In a company based on quick pivots, this is a very useful skill. 

Adam is a pleasure to work with and his easy going demure makes grueling processes like code reviews much less stressful. He fosters an atmosphere that I enjoy working in.

His code has been clean and he is very detail oriented in his PR Reviews. I have no concerns of sub par code finding its way into our repos either by his own hand or through PRs he's reviewed.

I look forward to continued development alongside Adam.",,,Ian Volkwein,ivolkwein@argo.ai,Adam Smith,asmith@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"The job creation wizard template that Adam set up was fairly simple to follow and easy to add new job wizards for the most part.  He also has a very clear direction where he wants to move OM, which makes for a very explicit pattern for new developers to follow (which is always a good thing when you are trying to drink from the fire hose on a new project).

Adam is a thorough code reviewer.  I have found all of his comments to be relevant and worthwhile (he is very good at calling you out on not adding unit tests). ",,,Henry Burke-Sweet,hburkesweet@argo.ai,Adam Smith,asmith@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Since coming to Argo in February, Adam has been the driving force behind the improvement in the operator management tool.  OM is used by every operator and manager using labeling and mapping tools.  Adam started and completed the conversion of OM from a JavaScript based application to TypeScript.  Using a statically typed language leads to catching potential bugs at compile time, rather than run time.  I think this also gave him a great opportunity to take a look at the codebase and gain a greater understanding of it. 
 
Although when he received the application it was functional, Adam has gone and implemented many features that we've always wanted in the application, including forms for the ability to create Jobs for operators, pagination of different views, and more intuitive completion statistics on the landing page.  Anything that makes Meredith & our operator's lives easier is a big win for their productivity.

From a general code authorship perspective, Adam consistently turns out quality code.  Most of my review comments on his PRs are typically small things here and there.  He's also strong in code readership.  We're currently working to get him to be an approved reader for TS/JS, which I expect to happen some time in Q3.",,,Ryan Waskiewicz,rwaskiewicz@argo.ai,Adam Smith,asmith@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Adam was brought on to the team and asked to make our Operator Management service into a completely viable product with very little guidance. He was able to quickly learn the concepts necessary to understands its functions, as well as describe them in ways that were accessible for others outside of the engineering team. We have gone from Operator Management basically just being a ""Get Task"" button for operators with a significant amount of engineering effort necessary to keep it running to a self-service product that the Labeling and Map Production leads can use to create work and ensure it is assigned to the correct people. This has taken away a tremendous amount of busywork from my schedule.

Adam has been instrumental in keeping our code review process running smoothly. He gets to code reviews that he is assigned quickly and is able to provide insightful feedback. Even when he's assigned a review for language or component that he isn't already well versed in he is able to provide useful comments because he does the research necessary to ensure that he understands the problem.",,,Eddie Jones,ejones@argo.ai,Adam Smith,asmith@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"Goals

**Improve TS/JS/Java code quality**
I'd like to focus on improving the quality of my code.  In my opinion my quality has been improving as I become more familiar with the technology stack and coding standards, but there is plenty of room to improve.  Also, I'd like to improve my code review skills as well. In both cases I'd like to reduce the number of comments by peers/readers on PRs that I've authored or reviewed. As a specific goal, I will aim to become a TS/JS reader before the end of the year.

**Improve React/Redux patterns**
I'm getting more familiar with React/Redux but I'd like to gain more knowledge of best practices, specifically in the areas of 
  - Redux state organization
  - Redux vs local state
  - Admin gated client routing
  - React-Router in general
  - Less verbose Redux action objects and action object getters

**Improve UX in Operator Management**
The Operator Management tool is young and much of the implementation has been focused purely on adding features.  As features are added, there are common patterns that we've omitted that we should document and implement.  Such as
  - General styles for page layouts/themes
  - Task centric content grouping
  - Confirmation modals for one way actions
  - Toasts/Notifications for asynchronous interactions
  - Manual saving vs instant updates
  - Better audit trails for actions

**Better balancing of features and speed of implementation**
Argo moves at a fast pace, with users waiting for functionality that will make their jobs easier.  I'd like to focus on producing the functionality that is needed without over-engineering or creating rework.  Part of this is knowing what the users need, and the other part is not staying heads down on a problem for too long.  ",,,Adam Smith,asmith@argo.ai,Adam Smith,asmith@argo.ai,Software,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"I was able to start contributing immediately to the team by helping get the Mountain View office ready to start handling vehicles.  Albeit there is still a lot of work to be done.  My main achievements have been in finalizing procedures for use throughout the operations team and prepping the responsible engineers that will take over for my in MV once I move out to Dearborn.

I hope to improve upon the Z0 build processes and get them even more efficient and effective for the Z1 build.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Alan has not been at Argo for a very long time, but he has already been able to make an impact at the company.  Due to Alan being located in Dearborn for a short period of time, we have had a limited amount of time to work together on things. This will change due to him moving to Dearborn this month. From what I have seen in our short period of interaction, Alan can take on multiple tasks at a time and he is good with working as a team on things. Below are some of the highlights that I have been able to identify:

- Ultrasonics Testing: Adam  and I worked very closely on the Z1 ultrasonics development testing. Data was collected and evaluated so that the hardware team could make a decision on whether or not Argo would be using ultrasonics in future designs.  
- Z0 Fleet inventory documentation: Alan played a big hand in maintaining our inventory documentation
- Keeping the Mountainview car up-to-date with hardware and software updates. 

Due to Alan being in the Mountainview location, the impact that he can make was fairly limited. The only car in that location cannot be driven autonomously on public roads at this time. With this being the case, there is not much to troubleshoot and fix. ",,,Bryan Barnette,bbarnette@argo.ai,Alan Yip,ayip@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"I have not had a large amount of direct collaboration time with Alan since he has started, but the little I have worked with him has been a positive experience. We worked together on some Fleetio integration projects and he was very creative and resourceful and came up with some very good ideas. We are still using these processes today and it has been working great! I think it was difficult to be the lone VehInt Engineer out in MTV and I think it will help the entire Team once he is closer to the action in Dbrn. ",,,Rob Vaniglia,rvaniglia@argo.ai,Alan Yip,ayip@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"I only worked with Alan on the ultrasound system verification in March 2018.

Alan had 
(1) Taken the test plan I have generated and converted the content into the step-by-step test procedure

(2) Generated the floor map for test objects to be placed at the grid points
Documented detailed object grid positions for each test. 

(3) Downloaded the 2D animation program I have generated to his laptop in order to record data.

(4) Took photos of the test configurations and organized them at Google Drive.

Alan and his teammate Bryan had worked closely together to collaborate the effort of data and image collection. 

Since it is a prototype experiment, there were several iterations on each test configuration based upon the vendor's firmware update. Alan had patiently finished the required tests in a timely fashion. 

He worked independently in Michigan according to the test plan without additional suggestions. He and Bryan managed to work in early hours in Michigan so that I can review the test data in California 3 hours later (due to time zone difference). In this way, we got to complete tests efficiently every day. 

This is the first time I worked with Alan. I will not be able to specify his growth from previous projects.",,,Cindy Hsieh,chsieh@argo.ai,Alan Yip,ayip@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"-Alan has shown dedication to the team by taking on any task that has been assigned to him
-He did a great job of handing off information while he was going to be out. He provided very detailed information about Z1 lidar developments and the current path forward to make it easy for the integration team to cover him while he was out.
-Alan took on the responsibility of maintaining the inventory of currently used parts and spare parts for Z0 fleet vehicles. He pulled all information into a single document helping the team accurately track the location and status of parts.
-Alan was able to perform several Z0 fleet wide changes to the vehicle in Moutainview with minimal support. This was a difficult task because he has been isolated from the rest of the integration team and took ownership of these tasks  and completed them quickly.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Alice has been the primary point of contact for anything dealing with the longitudinal refiners. I’m not immediately familiar with every task she has worked on, but I know that she has been responsible for many vehicle behavior improvements including coasting towards stop signs rather than being very aggressive and fixing the “mustache” problem that plagued the av in the fall. It is clear that she has designed and written a large portion of the refiner code, which is integral to the operation of the AV.

I have not looked at much of Alice’s code but instead have mostly had design and debugging discussions with her. I have found that, if I identify a bug that appears to be MC-related, she is often able to identify the root cause quickly. For example, I worked closely with her on the “driving too fast around corners” problem that the AV had during code red. She identified the problem after we spent a couple a couple hours debugging it together and came up with a solution shortly afterward. Similarly, when she saw the veering between parked cars problem firsthand in Pittsburgh, she identified the fix the same day, which improved a problem we had been having for several months.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Alice has been a great person to collaborate with.  She has been very helpful in trying to debug issues in the MC stack that we've observed, and has been equally helpful in identifying and guiding us to addressing bugs in the MP stack. 

Alice was able to address issues we had encountered with derating where the vehicle would not choose to take the desired deceleration into a derate.  We discussed and brainstormed ideas and she came up with a new approach that was implemented quickly. 

She has been very easy to work with.  She communicates frequently about things we are working on together and clearly communicates what she is observing and what conclusions have been made. She has been a great resource to bridge the motion planning and motion controls teams.",,,Ramadev Hukkeri,rhukkeri@argo.ai,Alice Kassar,akassar@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Accomplishments:
Alice is an integral part of the motion controls team when it comes to new feature implementation and testing. Her strength lies in the ability to write high quality C++ code fast and iterate on it in simulation and on the vehicle to get an MVP implementation that works. She is a solid independent contributor, and can reliably implement it and test features to see them though and enhance the in-vehicle experience. She has contributed multiple new features that did just that in the MC code base this last cycle. Coast mode and cut-in mode are some of the many features she has contributed this last cycle. 

Alice also is very skilled at debugging, especially in time-constrained situations. I worked with her when we travelled to Pittsburgh in March to support the Ford execs demo. She is very skilled at debugging issues in the car as well as come up with creative ways to solve problems. Based on what her and I observed in the car with veering behaviour she was able to write code in the car back at the depot and deploy it to test within less than hour. The solution she coded up enhanced the ride quality while veering substantially. 

Strengths:
As I mentioned before Alice has solid C++ coding skills as well as debugging skills. But she also is a fast learner. She had never written any python code professionally before this performance cycle, but had to work on tasks that fit in the data analysis framework which is coded in python. I worked with her closely then and reviewed her PRs, she was able to pick up a lot of python concepts and coding practices quickly. And she was very adamant about learning things the right way. She contributed the ability to generate json files based on offline analysis in python that can be used for certifying inputs passed to the MC QP solvers in the C++ code on the car. 

Alice also has the ability to critically think about a problem and think of all the ""what if"" cases that most people tend to miss. It makes her a better problem solver, but also allows her to have an impact on the MC team. I have spent countless hours with her and other team member debating and discussing how certain issues should be resolved or how to approach solving a certain problem. She adds a lot of value and good insight to these discussions. 

Growth and improvement:
I have seen Alice improve her skills in C++ 17 substantially this review cycle. She has made her goal to use more of the c++17 features in her code, as well as learn more about how to efficiently use Argo libraries such as error handling and diagnostics. I review a good chunk of her PRs and always see her style evolve to include new features. She has also grown her python coding skills in the past few months. I am very excited to see how she uses all those skills in the future. ",,,Gus Atmeh,gatmeh@argo.ai,Alice Kassar,akassar@argo.ai,Software,

",,,Johannes Strom,jstrom@argo.ai,Alice Kassar,akassar@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,manager,"Alice has had a huge impact in the development of the Motion Controls software stack.  Over the review period she has:
* Added modes (cut-in, coast) to the LongitudinalActionFilter and calibrated them effectively on vehicle
* Continued to progress the comfort and accuracy of the longitudinal stack
* Greatly improved lateral veering comfort via PathRefinerLat calibration and also code changes in the MP stack
* Refactored the SpeedLimiter for efficiency and performance
* Continued improvements to our visualization capability

In addition to newly added features, Alice is fantastic at (and admittedly enjoys :p ) diagnosing and resolving bugs.  You can often count on her to have a bugfix PR up within hours of the first reports of an issue.  Her capabilities extend beyond simple software bugs.  She is able to diagnose and resolve complicated system level and algorithmic problems as well.

Alice is great to work with when designing new features as well as improvements to old features.  She formulates concise design documentation and disseminates broadly.  She also pushed for whiteboard discussions (via Zoom with PT or in person in MI) to make sure that all parties understand the stated problem and proposed resolution.  She often contributed to design discussions in a thoughtful and productive way.  ",,,Scott Varnhagen,svarnhagen@argo.ai,Alice Kassar,akassar@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"What are some specific accomplishments, projects, and results that you drove during the review cycle timeframe?

Some of the important projects I have worked on recently involve :

Since the last performance review cycle, I have had a chance to implement new features on the car which improved ride quality and comfort as well as participate in debugging problems and bugs on the car. 

- Adding a new mode to the longitudinal behavior of the vehicle called COAST MODE. This mode triggers when approaching an obstacle (static or dynamic) to make the car coast toward the desired distance and then start slowing down. Initially, before COAST MODE was implemented, the car would try to get to the speed limit before slowing down for an obstacle. However, the common human behavior is more likely to stop increasing the vehicle speed and coast toward the obstacle before slowing down.

- Adding a new mode to the ACC behavior called CUT IN mode. This mode triggers when an obstacle vehicle cuts in in front of the autonomous vehicle at a distance smaller than the desired tracking distance. This mode will smoothly back up the autonomous vehicle (AV) to the desired position behind the obstacle, whereas before this mode was implemented the AV would aggressively brake to try to get back to the desired position.

- Distance to Stop input certification. This feature allows to use the refiner to compute the most aggressive possible stop.  Given the speed and acceleration of the car, It will feed the solver the required input to get an optimal solution within 25 iterations which uses maximum jerk and maximum brake.

- A speed limiter functionality  to allow slowing down to a desired speed at a certain distance. This application was used in the Derate  functionality to slow down the AV while veering around an obstacle

- Refactored and  added some functionality to the Autobox UDP driver task to handle the reconnect logic and multiple publishers

- Implement code for track ahead feature which is currently not being used yet and turned off

The important features I have improved on the car:

- Veering around obstacle. I have calibrated the lateral refiner to smoothly veer around obstacle and avoid veering back to the lane center while veering around multiple obstacle with a wide gap in between them.

- Smoothly getting back to the lane center after a veer ends. This code was implemented but was never triggered because there was a bug in passing a state around. After debugging some logs I found and fixed the bug.

- I have proposed a new stopping calibration which removes the double stopping behavior that was noticed on the AV.

- I have written code to fix the ""mustache"" that the lateral refiner was computing around tight corners.


What are areas where you have grown and made improvements?

During the last few month I have learned how to code in python and I have improved my C++ coding skills to abide by the coding standards and contain more new C++ 17 language feature. I mostly concentrated on making the code better structured and well tested, as well as improving older code. I have worked on documenting all the work being done, proposing design documents before implementing new features as well as leaving feedback on AI tickets and issues to keep them up to date. 

I have also participated in in-vehicle testing in Pittsburgh and in Dearborn as a test engineer. Good cooperation, detailed VTR's and communication with the operation teams is required in order to get efficient testing and results.  I am very particular about testing my code as much as possible before adding it to the stack (regression tests, resim, simulation and in vehicle autonomous testing on the track and on public road).

I have occasionally met with Motion Planning members  (Ramadev and Chris mostly) to brainstorm about the current state of the code, the approaches which are being used and how to make the system better an more efficient.  Meetings with Motion Planning also involved debugging problems that are happening on the car. Sitting in a zoom meeting and debugging problems together, having the ability to ask questions back and forth has proven to be very efficient at finding and solving bugs. I have interactively worked with team members (Scott and Ghassan) to discuss problems and debug together. I am getting better about communicating with other teams the problems that we are seing (example a test failing or a task crashing) and about the necessary tools that we might need in the future to facilitate debugging, testing or creating a new application (simulation scenarios, simulation tools ).",,,Alice Kassar,akassar@argo.ai,Alice Kassar,akassar@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"What are some areas where you can grow and improve?
I want to expand my knowledge about all the C++ libraries and tools contained in the AV repo, and all the new functionality that C++ 17 introduces. I want to be approved as a C++ reader as well as keep improving my python coding skills. I am being more and more diligent about keeping my JIRA tickets and issues up to date especially when it comes to a problem which is being resolved or should be redirected to another team. I want to get more understanding of the motion planning stack and write necessary tools in order to facilitate debugging.

One more thing I definitely want to improve is to better communicate the timeline needed for a bugfix to be implemented, an application to be landed, especially if other team have to develop on top of what is being fixed.

I want to expand the refiners capabilities and try to accommodate more and more the requests of motion planning without regressing the stack.

Some of the code I have landed have regressed some corner case situations somewhere else. However, it is really hard to catch those regressions without a robust testing regression framework. I want to focus on getting the motion control simulation scenarios used for regressions advanced enough to be able to land code and minimize as many regressions as possible.

What are some projects where you could have done better?

There are some features where the code has to be implemented fast in order to support a specific demo. (example cut ins and coast mode). Those applications did not have a detailed design review before they were implemented and there were some disagreements on the code architecture after they were written. I think for the future, I should give myself more time for design documents to be read and addressed before the actual implementation is being delayed.

",,,Alice Kassar,akassar@argo.ai,Alice Kassar,akassar@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,manager,"Alice has made vast improvements to her organization and documentation over the review period.  These are some additional areas for her to focus in order to continue improving at Argo!

Alice often has lots of project in flight at one time, which is fantastic.  However, she needs to work on bringing projects across the finish line.  If a PR is hanging open, Alice needs to take the initiative to corral the necessary reviews and curate the necessary tests so that the code can land and the issue can be closed.  In addition, Alice needs to circle back and ensure that her closed features are operating as expected.  One such example was the discovery that the S-max-hard constraints imposed on velocity-mode to resolve the MP intersection planning issues had not in fact made its way into develop.  A simple mistake, but more attention during the closing of issues would help Alice to prevent these mistakes in the future.

As a Motion Controls team we need to improve our regression testing capability.  In order to aid in this, Alice should begin to consider not only features to be developed, but also metrics to measure the efficacy of these features.  As we become more mature, changes we make in one portion of the code are more likely then ever to regress a different area.  Having metrics to measure and test against will help us to catch regressions before they make it into the fleet.  Because Alice is so reliable at resolving issues, she often is tasked with high priority and time sensitive work which does not afford time for metrics/simulation regression test development.  However, a small amount of time could be dedicated to documenting what metrics and testing **should** be implemented.  We can then schedule this work (for Alice or for other team members) at a later time.  

Finally, Alice has participated greatly in the design of the Motion Controls algorithms and software stack.  However, she can often get set in seeing problems in only one way.  For future designs, it would be useful for Alice to consider at least three solutions to the problem at hand.  She can then weight the pros/cons of each solution and come to a data driven decision about which to implement.  She may find that multiple solutions offer different advantages, and is unable to easily chose the winner.  These types of problems are prime candidates for a broader design discussion, where we can leverage the experience of other team members in making thoughtful design decisions.  ",,,Scott Varnhagen,svarnhagen@argo.ai,Alice Kassar,akassar@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Alice could probably work on thinking through the edge cases and extensibility of different features and design choices. For example, when debugging a problem together, we discovered that the AV’s trajectory was not planning on stopping at a stop line, so MP was scoring the result as if it was going through the intersection at a red light. Alice pushed for having MP look at the discrete mode of the refiner, which is not an extensible, long-term solution for MP. This particular issue could have also been solved by better communication between the motion planning and control teams, so that both teams have better understandings about how the other’s system is designed.",,,Chris Cunningham,ccunningham@argo.ai,Alice Kassar,akassar@argo.ai,Software,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Since starting at Argo in February, I have worked hard to learn the company, the culture and my position. I strive to deliver work that is completed in a timely, efficient and thorough manner, endeavoring to evaluate the scope of a task before jumping in so that I can work smart and avoid double work and wasted time.

In the short time that I have been here, I feel that I have been able to learn the day to day expectations of my position. In my New Hire Roadmap it was highlighted that I would be assisting with the food programs; I complete stocks of the kitchen, ensuring to rotate food items and check expiration dates to ensure freshness of product, monitor levels and pass reorder requests onto Amy as needed; I have also compiled a list of snack options that can be referenced and new items pulled from when it is noted that interest in a particular item seems to be waning. Outside of the PIT Crane site, I sourced catering vendors for both the New Stanton and Miami sites, with one site needing a hot catered lunch and the other boxed lunches & beverage service. With both New Stanton and Miami, I serve as the primary contact to the catering companies to provide the caterers head counts, layout menus for Miami, update the caterers with special requests and communicate any changes to the service schedule. 

As part of working towards seamless day-to-day operations, I have added the use of a supply cart to the daily conference room/space reset walks. This allows for the morning reset walk of the space to be more efficient as it is not necessary to backtrack for supplies to fill stock in conference rooms. 

In the vein of completing walkthroughs of the PIT Crane and Depot spaces, I have also started completing the weekly facilities walkthroughs of these sites. These more in depth walks allow for me to be more proactive in correcting problems. By updating the weekly sheet, I can track problems in the space and ensure that tickets are opened to address any issues.

For the PIT Crane site I have also taken on the responsibility of ensuring that the people seated in Locactor are correct. I review the tool weekly to catch any errors, update when team or self moves are completed and update the tool to reflect the seating of new hires. I also report any bugs that I find with the functionality of the Locator to IT so they can be addressed.

To support our site and companies safety needs I assisted in the creation of the PIT Crane and Depot SDS binders. I completed space walkthroughs; noted products that required a SDS sheet; located and printed the sheets and passed them to Kelly Bennett to complete the assembly of the binder.  The PIT Crane site was also in need of Evacuation Maps; I made a base space template for them and created the layout of where they were to be placed and marked out how each map should look so that the project could be passed to Kelly Bennett for final design work to be completed. Finally, during my weekly space walkthroughs, I noted that the spaces fire extinguishers were out of date. The extinguisher maintenance is completed by the LL/PM so I touched base with him to get the timeline of when Fire Safety would be in to inspect and update the extinguishers. After the inspection, I completed my own check to ensure that all had been updated and was able to identify one more that had been inadvertently missed by them and have that updated as well.

Overall, in the time that I have been here I feel that I have been able to make a positive impact on the space. I hope to continue to learn and advance my skill set.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Since joining Argo in February, Amanda has proved to be an invaluable member of our Facilities team. She strives to exceed expectations for every task thrown her way, serving as an exemplary leader and mentor. Amanda’s extensive facilities experience is shown throughout the high level of service she provides to both our team and the company as a whole.

Amanda has made it her priority to ensure that daily conference room resets occur, ensuring Argo’s employees have a clean and productive environment to work in. She put together a cart full of supplies to use for those morning resets within the first month she was here. 

She has also made weekly walkthroughs a priority for both Crane and the Depot. Admittedly, before Amanda arrived, the Depot was not getting as much attention as it could be - not for lack of effort, but rather, lack of team members. Now while I’m on reception desk duty, Amanda makes sure to head over to the Depot and preform a weekly inspection. She looks for things that are out of place, dirty, in need of a reset, stock levels, etc. When she sees something that isn’t up to Argo standards, she make sure to rectify the issue. For example, just last week she set up a meeting with Depot’s cleaning crew since the space was not being adequately taken care of. She is now closely monitoring the situation to ensure the cleaning crew has taken her notes seriously and will do a more thorough job. Her attention to detail is impeccable. 

Amanda also took the initiative to set up a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) binder for Crane. Before working here, I was unfamiliar with the process of setting up an SDS binder from scratch. She walked me through the steps and was extremely helpful, just how she’s been for every other task I've looked for assistance on. She also worked hard to outline five fire escape routes with corresponding maps to bring us up to code, prioritizing the safety of our employees.
 
Amanda has a very pleasant demeanor and works extremely well with others. These indispensable traits have led to mutually beneficial business to business relationships between multiple vendors and Argo. For example, Amanda researched, presented to management, and ultimately chose caterers for both New Stanton and Miami. New Stanton’s caterer has been understanding and flexible for the site’s unique needs and ever-changing schedule/head counts. While the caterer employees an exceptional staff, I credit that great find to Amanda.  I feel as though I personally can learn a lot from her, especially how to foster these types of vendor relationships. 

Miami’s catering has not been so easily executed - there have been many bumps in the road, mostly due to lack of understanding for what type of services are to be provided directly from Argo and to who. Amanda has handled these issues with a graceful patience, and has taken the suggestions and questions in stride. She has been communicating directly with Daniel Funnen, who works in Miami and has raised these issues, and with the caterer in order to provide the best level of service for this particular site.

Amanda is a great teacher - I learn something new from her on a daily basis. For example, due to unforeseen circumstances that hit all members of the Facilities Team except me, I was here alone for a couple days back in March. The day before her medical PTO, Amanda sat down with me and outlined what it takes to keep the office stocked on all facets (a task that has never been delegated solely to me before). This includes the snacks we provide in the office, drinks, catering, Eco Products, office supplies etc.. She explained what stock levels should look like, and outlined a prediction of the week’s consumption while she would be out. By taking the time to explain to me how to manage an office alone (and doing it all from the reception desk), Amanda provided me with the tools to get through that week and, more importantly, the tools to become a better employee. While this may seem like a small feat, it is crucial to the functionality of Argo’s internal operations. I am grateful she has joined this team. 
",,,Kelly Bennett,kbennett@argo.ai,Amanda Leight,aleight@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Amanda has been a great asset to Argo.  From the day that Amanda started at Argo, she has had an impact on the organization!  She brings a positive attitude to her work and all of her tasks!  She is also able to collaborate with other groups and help them accomplish their work; Amanda has collaborated with IT and Vehicle Ops just to name a few.

Amanda has many tasks that she is responsible for and she does all of them well!  She has made a huge difference in the cleanliness and organization of the conference rooms.  Each morning Amanda does her walk through to make sure that each room has what it needs as far as office supplies go and she also makes sure that all white boards are clean to start the day.  This is a huge improvement over how this was being done prior to her arrival.  Previously, the cleanliness of the rooms was hit or miss, it just depended on whether or not the person who was responsible that day took the time to perform this task.  The consistency and care that Amanda gives to this task really makes a difference in the functionality of the rooms!  And she thinks of everything!!  She has improved the process overall and is super efficient with it!  She has a cart where you can find anything that you would need to complete this walk through!   

Amanda also covers the reception desk - she doe a fabulous job!  Amanda makes all guests coming into Argo feel welcome!  She is a super star with following process and she makes sure that each person signs in and she collets their badges when they leave.   Amanda is also super conscientious and brought to leaderships attention that Argo did not have a process or policy around serving of papers.  This was a gap that we were able to address with a policy and a process, but could have been an uncomfortable conversation the first time this was attempted if she had not had this addressed.  

This ties right into Amanda's other task of weekly walk throughs for our two PIT sites, Crane and the Depot.  Amanda pays great attention to details which makes her perfect for this position.  Between her attention to details and her past experience, Argo has benefited from her being a part of the team.  Amanda does her walk throughs of the sites weekly catching any new or lingering problems and then she makes sure that the correct people are aware to have these issues addressed quickly and completely.  She will either open a ticket within the Argo ticketing system or she will work directly with the appropriate parties to get the issue resolved.  Moving forward this process will be trained to all site coordinators so that the same thoughtful approach can be taken at all Argo sites.

Amanda is also responsible for ensuring that all snacks and drinks are stocked and maintained.  This includes making sure that product is reordered, stocked and that the expiration dates are checked and product rotated to ensure freshness.  This can be a thankless job, but in our organization and culture, this is a very important job!  Amanda takes this seriously and does a great job keeping up with these tasks daily!

Another strength of Amanda's is her ability to negotiate and maintain vendor relationships.  She does a great job interfacing with vendors and understands what is and is not important to Argo; she is able to clearly and concisely convey that to the vendors in a way that is positive and helpful!  She does a great job in this area!

Overall, I believe that Amanda has had a impact on Argo's environment from day one!  Her positive personality and her awesome work ethic is just what is needed in a service position like facilities!!",,,Kelly Mullins,kmullins@argo.ai,Amanda Leight,aleight@argo.ai,General & Administrative,

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"I believe that Amanda will continue to excel and grow the more familiar she becomes with Argo. What I’d really like to see her do is spend some more time at the Depot during the week. This has been a difficult task from the start since, between her and I, the reception desk needs to be covered daily from 8:30am-5pm. While having four hours off the desk to move about the Office and Depot freely may seem like a long time, it flies by faster than one would think. If given the time, I think Amanda could make tremendous improvements in the Depot’s appearance, stock, and overall contractor happiness. This doesn’t, however, mean I think she is doing a poor job of managing the space as is - since February, her changes and attentiveness have been overwhelmingly helpful. If she could spend maybe an hour a day there for some TLC, I think productivity would continue to increase.

I also think Amanda would benefit from the opportunity to learn more about Liebert/Crac units, HVAC systems, etc. that occupy our space. I know she has voiced her desire for this as well; however, we have talked extensively how she would like to broaden her knowledge about these types of fixtures in order to become a better point of contact between Argo and our vendors. She certainly has the mental capacity to understand why certain alarms are sounding, or why temperature isn’t being well regulated. If she is given the option to learn more about these systems and better explain to service contractors what exactly is sounding off, I think technical problems like these throughout the office could be resolved quicker and more efficiently. ",,,Kelly Bennett,kbennett@argo.ai,Amanda Leight,aleight@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"One of the areas that I feel I can improve in is having a better understanding of the teams and who reports to whom. The org chart is a great resource and I will continue to use it to look people and teams up but I would like to better internalize that information. I feel that this will help me to better know my coworkers, which in facilities translates to being able to better anticipate and meet needs. 

I would also like to improve my knowledge and understanding of Liebert/Crac units; when we get an alarm from one of the Lieberts in the Depot, I unfortunately have little base knowledge about the units. While I wouldn’t anticipate myself making repairs to the units, I would like to have a more solid grasp of how the units function and what the error codes mean so that I can better interface with the repair vendor.

Finally, I feel that I could better serve in providing coverage for Kelly if I better understood and could use the tools she uses in her design work, especially photoshop. If she is out on a day when a new hire starts, I am not savvy to the tools necessary to get the badge edited to having a solid white background and this slows down the process in getting the badge to the new hire. If I learn this system, I could serve as a backup for her in editing badge photos and I would also be able to make any small changes to menus if late updates come in.

Overall, I believe that my skill set and my ability to be an asset to Argo will continue to improve with time as that will enable me to grow my knowledge base and take on added responsibilities.

Amanda has taken on the tasks of providing food services for two off sites, New Stanton and Miami.  Considering Amanda's ability to work with vendors and her attention to details, I would like to see her develop a comprehensive food service plan for all non-corporate offices at Argo.  As we grow, it will be more and more important to have a plan to quickly initiate these services as new sites come up.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"I started at Argo in mid-February, so this self-review encompasses approximately 10 weeks of work, and significantly the end-of-March demo.

My primary task during this time has been to generate predictions of tracked objects such that the AV is able to navigate through protected and unprotected intersections.  This has been a unique challenge as we have not started from scratch but rather modified and adapted the original prediction code incrementally, so as to avoid significant setbacks in the in-car performance.  Such setbacks would be detrimental to MPs ability to progress on the challenges they are currently tackling.

I have certainly made some missteps (for example I was initially overly trusting of simulation results and failed to fully consider the full scope of non-compliant behavior at stop signs), but overall I am personally proud of my performance at Argo.  I feel that I have gotten up to speed quickly, not only on prediction code, but issues relating to mapping, log replay, and autonomy integration.  I have developed close working relationships with people across teams (most notably Dale, Chris, Ben, Larry, and Tim).  I feel that I have become someone who is relied upon not only to make progress on feature development but to triage and address bugs.

Within my own team, I have tried to support Peter, John, and Slawek to the best of my ability, through code reviews and or help.  Perhaps, more importantly, I have tried to be aware of and gracious for the significant amount of time they have spent helping me with my own work.  With there help, I feel that my own abilities as a C++ developer have grown significantly.

Finally, I have spent time preparing as an interviewer.  Giving coding interviews/tech screens in C++ was outside of my comfort zone, so I have worked on calibrating a few questions and working out several possible solution paths for each.",,,Andrew Hartnett,ahartnett@argo.ai,Andrew Hartnett,ahartnett@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Andrew’s main accomplishment was the logic implementation for predictions at 2-way and at 4-way intersections. These are very challenging tasks and require a lot of tests on vehicle to tune proper AV behavior. 

Andrew’s big asset is also his openness. Within a few weeks, Andrew made contacts between various teams and currently, when I am looking for a person with particular responsibilities, Andrew is a go-to person to point out the right resource.
 
Additionally, Andrew is a go-to person when brainstorming a design, and the future of prediction models, which will require data-driven approach.

He has done a great job of getting up to speed quickly on C++ Programming and software development tools.  Andrew has also been very helpful in providing feedback on features that other team members are developing to ensure they meet the required specifications.  Andrew is also very good at communicating between members of the prediction team as well as with members from other teams when we encounter questions with code or tools outside of our own.",,,John Matty,jmatty@argo.ai,Andrew Hartnett,ahartnett@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Andrew joined Argo around the beginning of the push for the March demo. Andrew got up to speed very quickly in terms of how to approach the problem as well as in his generally understanding of the system as a whole. His main task has been to improve how predicted movers handle intersection, specifically determining turn order at four way stops. He first wrote the code to get predictions to stop at stop signs. Then he started working on the turn order code. In order to ensure that it was working before the demo, he worked extra hours, staying late at the office debugging on-vehicle behavior. Based on this push, he is now the one of the people go to when they have question about prediction intersection logic.

Because he doesn’t have a strong C++ background, he was a little slower getting comfortable contributing the codebase. However, his code has been improving steadily. He is open to changing his code based on PRs and interested and understanding the “why?” behind some coding style choices, which is very important. In addition, he puts in effort to review others’ PRs both for approach and coding style. His reviews have been improving as well. 
",,,Chris Cunningham,ccunningham@argo.ai,Andrew Hartnett,ahartnett@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"I have worked with in a few meetings and also have been through the interview process with him.   I have also helped him through some items when he was getting onboarded.  He was very quick to learn the stack and how to work within what was going on.  Particularly when he was asked to make the video i was able to quickly communicate how to get the gui setup to take the video.  He seems to balance trying to find the answer to the problem and coming over to ask for the solution well.  Some engineers go to far down either road which can reduce productivity but Andrew has a great balance there.

In the interview process we had fruitful discussions on what qualities to look for in a candidate.  The reverse shadow went particularly well.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"I have numerous dimensions over which I need to improve.  For the purpose of this review I would like to highlight two:

1.  While improving rapidly, I am not yet a strong C++ developer.  As a result, I am not as efficient as I could be in translating ideas into PRs.  Additionally, while improving, I would like to get better at submitting PRs requiring fewer review fixes.  That same expertise would also allow me to give more thorough code reviews and feel more confident in applying to become a reader.  

2.  As mentioned above, in my first few weeks at Argo, I was overly reliant upon simple simulation scenarios to test my code.  As a result, I did not write robust code ready to handle the real world.  This was a big slow down and led to several other people staying late into the night leading up to the demo.  While often time-consuming, I need to make a continual push to test things at all levels: sim, logs, and on the car.",,,Andrew Hartnett,ahartnett@argo.ai,Andrew Hartnett,ahartnett@argo.ai,Software,

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"While his c++ code has gotten better in the past couple months, there is still room improvement, which will certainly come as he gets more experience.

Another area of improvement is testing and verification of changes before landing new features in the repository. In part because of the rush for the demo, some of the four-way stop intersection handling ended up breaking intersections with only two stop signs. A focus should be to improve testing of new features to ensure that there are no regressions. This will certainly be easier to improve as our regression testing framework improves as well.

Andrew was welcoming to all team members for the duration of their stay and was readily available to answer questions as they arose. Andrew was always willing to put in the extra time to make sure that work was complete- arriving early in the morning and oftentimes staying as late as 7pm. Another accomplishment of Andrew’s this past cycle was becoming more involved in the recruiting process, specifically in promoting diversity. Andrew volunteered to attend the Lesbians Who Tech conference in San Francisco to assist with recruiting efforts. Andrew did an incredible job of representing Argo as a company, and showcasing the amazing culture here. He talked to countless attendees, selling the vision of Argo and detailing his personal experience. Even though the conference was three days (including a Saturday), Andrew kept his energy up the entire time and really helped draw people in to our booth with his enthusiasm and warm demeanor. Though Andrew had never worked directly with the recruiting team before, he was able to seamlessly incorporate himself and worked well with all team members.

For example, he developed the month end close calendar and leads monthly status check-ins for the entire A&C / AP team. His positive, ""we can do this"" attitude is contagious and the team looks to him for guidance often. For example, I meet with Andrew weekly to bounce ideas off of him and collaborate on policy developments, such as fixed asset capitalization threshold at invoice or line item level, Rev vs DiscOps treatment for forecasts (particularly for PLI accounting impacts0, and how to track assets for budget status reporting / impairment testing / depreciation FAM / by project code / etc

Additionally, Andrew takes on new challenges with that same positive, ""we can do this"" attitude.

As soon as he started he was in the midst of the PLI acquisition, which was an incredibly important transaction for Argo.  He stepped right in, and by the end of the fiscal year, he was my go-to for all things acquisition related.  He became the subject matter expert on ASC 805, and thanks to Andrew and Ming, our accounting team executed the transaction in line with Accounting and Tax regulations.
Other accounting tasks that Andrew immediately took on, were updating our COA and getting our Fixed Assets into FAM so that we would have a depreciation schedule by the time the PWC auditors arrived for interim testing at the end of 2017.  Updating the COA involved a delicate balance of maintaining current structure and implementing new accounts that were in line with our newly implemented budget and forecast.  Andrew was able to complete this task to everyone’s satisfaction, and as a result, we have a chart of accounts that is easy to follow and make GL account additions to without compromising structure.  Andrew also had to spend a lot of time working with NetSuite, which can prove trying, to make sure all of our Fixed Assets made it in to FAM.  Andrew, Tyler, and I worked together to scrub all FA accounts since the inception of Argo so that we had a full listing to put in to FAM.  We were able to tie the detail out to the penny, which was not an easy task, but as a result we had a full listing of Fixed Assets and a caught-up depreciation schedule by the time the auditors arrived for interim testing.
Andrew jumped right in to learning NetSuite independently, as it was a system he did not have prior experience with.  He also jumped right in to catching up our prepaid amortization schedule and balance sheet reconciliations, which were of high importance to Ford.  Andrew has made a significant, positive impact on the Ford relationship by helping to implement a 3 day Argo month-end close, providing a day for review on day 4, and providing numbers to Ford on day 5.  He communicates effectively with our Ford contact, keeping her apprised of new accounts for mapping purposes and any significant fluxes identified in the review process, which has gone a long way for the relationship.
Perhaps most impressive has been Andrew’s creation of the first ever set of Argo Financial Statements for the years ended 2016 and 2017.  As a new company, Argo was subject to a first-year audit, which was completed with no audit adjustments.  A huge accomplishment. This involved completing a lengthy audit disclosure checklist with no prior documentation for reference and working through multiple rounds of comments from various PwC partners and team members as well as Argo leadership.  Not only was the audit completed successfully, but it was done so on time, without tax extensions being filed, which was the goal.
Additionally, Andrew has contributed to multiple policies and procedures updates and creation in conjunction with reviewing a plethora of Ford FMs.  He successfully and efficiently led Argo through the 2017 1099 process, and he participates in recruiting efforts via interviews and conferences.
As Andrew and I work incredibly closely together on accounting related tasks, it has been a pleasure to have him as a team member.  I trust his knowledge and value his input.  He is always available to bounce ideas off of, and answer questions.  He embraces Argo’s culture, and he has been a huge asset to not only the accounting and finance team, but to Argo as a whole.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Joining the Argo Finance team in early October, still very early on in Argo's existence, provided a time frame with plenty of challenges to tackle for this review period. Some projects included:

1) Successful audit completion - PwC arrived on site the first week of March 2018 to complete the 2017 financial statement audit. With Argo being such a new company and the challenge of changing ERP's mid-2017 there was a lot of pressure to make sure the audit went smoothly and that there were minimal or immaterial errors as a result. A lot of the work done to catch-up depreciation and prepaid amortization was intended to make sure those expenses passed the audit as a large portion involved manual input to FAM or the prepaid amortization schedule. Emily Ruscetti led the communication with PwC and I was responsible for compiling Argo's first set of financial statements complete with disclosures which was a brand new experience to me. Both of us worked well together answering questions as they came in from the audit team or funneling them to the appropriate Argo employee that could assist in providing a response. As with any audit it was important to keep information flowing to and from the audit team which can be challenging when normal day-to-day activities require your attention as well. PwC's substantive testing revealed no audit adjustments or errors and the final consolidated financial statements were signed off on April 18, 2018, a huge accomplishment for the accounting team and Argo which I was proud to have a significant role in.

2) Audited financial statement preparation - The final step of a financial statement audit is to produce a full set of financial statements that include notes and disclosures detailing significant transactions that occurred during the audit period. In previous roles I’ve been accustomed to having prior year statements to reference when it came time to update the results and corresponding notes, however, with this being Argo’s first ever audit I was tasked with creating the document from scratch. This process required researching accounting policy to determine proper methods of disclosure as well as constant communication with the audit team to review drafts and implement edits from multiple parties. The final document stands as confirmation to internal and external viewers that Argo is complying with GAAP and that there are no operational concerns so it was extremely important to execute this project with diligence. The audited financial statements and notes were signed off as noted above and remain a significant accomplishment for me in this role as well as for Argo and its leadership.

3) Chart of Accounts refresh - the COA, which stands as the basis for all detailed financial reporting, was already developed to provide a reasonable breakout of expense types, but needed some account code alignment and additional accounts and secondary field structure to capture other aspects of the business. This was my first time collaborating with Jen DeBrincat on a project and between her extremely quick ramp up on forecasting needs and my experience with various chart of account structures we were able to implement the new COA in the first quarter of 2018. We had to ensure various preferences for the structure were taken into account while remaining devoted to making sure the end result was operationally beneficial. Once the COA was approved it took two close periods to make sure activity was carefully and accurately transferred from the old to new structure through various NetSuite uploads.

4) PLI - Soon after starting at Argo in early October I was given the responsibility to ensure the accounting for the acquisition of PLI was in compliance with extensive policy around business combinations (ASC 805) which ended up being the most significant transaction for Argo in 2017 second only to the actual Ford investment. This involved making a trip to New Jersey to meet with both the external valuation team (E&Y) and the PLI team to get a handle on the scope of the transaction. In relation to this project I was also added to bi-weekly communications with our external tax team (BDO) to make sure we were in compliance with IRS and state regulations surrounding the conversion of PLI to an LLC sometimes standing as the only Argo representative on the calls to make sure things continued to progress under tight deadlines. From a reporting perspective I also took on the task of mapping PLI accounts to Argo’s for a seamless consolidation process every month starting in November 2017.

5) Month-end close - The close process is a crucial part of the business that ensures transactions are being captured accurately and completely. I was given the responsibility to develop the process and make sure that things previously postponed such as depreciation expense, prepaid amortization, and stock-based compensation were implemented into the normal close procedures as well as develop financial statements (balance sheet and cash flow) that could be used in monthly reporting to Pete and Bryan to supplement the department level forecast-to-actuals. In another collaborative effort with Jen we make sure this reporting includes comments for variances that meet certain thresholds. The monthly meetings we hold have provided a consistent benchmark for financial performance to allow better decision making by leadership. 

6) Ford reporting and relationship - Another part of the month-end close process requires the accounting team to provide Ford with a trial balance by day five that reconciles to the individually consolidating entities. Ford had been receiving a simple data dump from NetSuite for this, but after a meeting in November 2017 with both Ford accounting and product development it became clear we needed to provide better reporting to maintain a healthy relationship. I took the opportunity to create a report that could be completed alongside the normal close reporting that mapped Argo accounts to Ford’s structure as well as provided an ending Ford-mapped trial balance that saved them time entering into their ERP system. I keep consistent communication with both Ford teams and have been able to ease some unnecessary workload from their plates which has seemed to strengthen our relationship with Ford HQ.

7) Lesbians Who Tech conference - An Argo-all email went out in February 2018 requesting any interest to attend this conference to help further Argo's commitment to diversity. I was initially hesitant to attend knowing the event was targeting more engineering-based individuals in the LGBT community as opposed to G&A roles, but after discussing with the Recruiting team and Ming I was encouraged to participate. It was a great experience and allowed me to collaborate with team members I wouldn't normally have the opportunity to work with as well as see the excitement in the industry for what Argo is trying to achieve. The logistics worked out well as I was able to help answer general questions people had about Argo while the Recruiting team responded to questions more specific to the roles that were available.

8) 1099 issuance - as 2017 came to a close and the deadline for 1099's to be issued quickly approached it was evident we did not have a good process in place to make this happen. Non-compliance with 1099's can result in significant penalties from the IRS so it was important to get something in place fast. Emily Ruscetti and Jesse Serena were able to help pull together vendor data which included making calls and sending emails to verify information. Knowing we were short on time for mailing I researched alternative methods to mailing every form and IRS copy out. After finding a few options that seemed to fit price and function I worked with the legal team to ensure the software terms were acceptable and was able to get the 1099 forms out on time. No 1099 corrections were required by the IRS.

The finance/accounting team is small in number so it's important there is cohesion among the individual contributors. I feel that I helped create a positive work environment to the benefit of me and my fellow team members which helped bring levity to sometimes demanding situations both in time and energy. It's great to see so many people share the ""work hard, play hard"" mentality. Overall, I feel my contribution to the team and Argo in the Senior Accountant role was crucial and sometimes found myself stepping into more advanced responsibilities which was a welcome challenge that provided professional growth. Very happy to be at Argo and working with everyone on the Finance team.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Nuk has initiated and has collaborated on a host of improvements across the operations team.
Specifically, when I joined the Argo team, he was the main vehicle operator lead for the operations team. While I noticed that there was also a second lead, (Dave Hart), performing a similar level of support, I was shocked to hear that Dave had only joined Argo the week prior, and in that amount of time, appeared to be providing the same level of support and mentorship that Nuk was providing! This speaks enormously to the fact that while the position can be very technical and at times chaotic, he can break it down and have someone performing at the same level in a relatively short amount of time. This is also unique in that Dave also didn't have the same level of experience in the self-driving industry, but was speaking to and working through troubleshooting steps at the same pace and experience level as Nuk.

I was also impressed at the number of processes and procedures that Nuk helped to established prior to the build up of fleet operations. From the daily tracker used to assign operators to vehicles and then missions, to the method of tracking data ingest, he built the tools to a level that facilitated quick data entry, while also remaining very readable and easily referenced when researching historical information.

One very important area that Nuk contributed toward, is in vehicle incident response. As our team grew, he realized the importance of introducing the swelling number of operators to hands on incident response training, and worked to cycle small groups through a basic vehicle incident response workshop in the garage. Ironically, it would be these sessions that would help to provide a reference to he and others involved in a recent vehicle incident. This knowledge and training led to the calm demeanor and professional handling of an incident,  becoming the benchmark of training and reference for incident handling going forward.

Nuk also works extremely well in a collaborative environment. As the vehicle operator team has grown, he has worked to help pass on his experience and knowledge to the newest operations leads. With the addition of four new leads, he worked to introduce them to the greater vehicle operator team, where they were quickly embraced as leaders, in not only Pittsburgh but in the first launch city as well. In this mentorship, he helped to demonstrate, and hold them accountable to the expectations of the position, while continuing to provide mentorship and feedback on areas of improvement.

Finally, Nuk is technically minded, and digs in to explore new features or issues brought to his attention. Without hesitation, he makes a focused effort to explore new releases and vehicle capabilities, gaining valuable first hand knowledge which can then be immediately applied to first (and usually second level) diagnosis, not possible from those without firsthand knowledge of the self-driving system and operator tooling.",,,Matthew Priest,mpriest@argo.ai,Anuruk Buranathanit,aburanathanit@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Nuk is an absolute joy to work with. I really feel like him and I make an amazing team and share a brain sometimes. 

Nuk can create any google sheet at a moments notice to handle whatever is asked of him. Nuk was the original creator of the Mission Tracker, something that started out as a ""temp"" document and it has grown into a tracking device for VO's, vehicles, VTR's and mileage that is currently used by 3 cities!

Nuk brings an energy to every conversation and meeting with our VO's. He knows how to be friendly with everyone, without being friends. He truly has a gift with that. 

Nuk is humble and never looks at things in an ""I"" mentality. He is a team player through and through. 

Nuk is excited for any time he can get in a car. He will run any VTR asked of him, Hop in as a odd man in to get an AV on the road, as well as evaluating our VO's from the backseat. 

Nuk was instrumental in helping train Dan and Marlon to do what we do. 

Nuk focuses on the big picture at all times, and truly cares for what he does. It is a joy to work with him day in and day out. I couldn't imagine doing what I do without him.",,,David Hart,dhart@argo.ai,Anuruk Buranathanit,aburanathanit@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Nuk is the type of person that you feel comfortable asking questions, Nuk is a team player and willing to help and has great attitude and work ethic. For example Nuk has worked many late hours willing to give up his personal activities to step-up and make sure things get done. I have great respect for Nuk and think he does a great job.

Nuk has a awesome personality and gets along with everyone. VO's respect and enjoy Nuk's easy going attitude and fun personality but they also want to do a good job and not disappoint him, which is a great combo.

Specifics:
1. Nuk does a great job getting the schedule on the tracker and discussing the tracker at AM brief with the VO's, Nuk shows great group communication skills. Nuk also does a great job of letting everyone know they are doing a good job.

2. Nuk shows great ability to multi-task and keeps calm even with stressful situations and when things get very busy. Nuk is always respectful of others and very kind even when he is stressed.

3. Nuk does a great job with troubleshooting, keeping a good eye on slack and making sure all the VTR's and VSR's are getting done.

4. Nuk does a great job with EOS brief, asking great questions, moving the brief along and making sure everyone knows we all appreciate the hard work. 
",,,Lisa Fischer,lfischer@argo.ai,Anuruk Buranathanit,aburanathanit@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"In the two months since joining the team and having Nuk as a peer has shown  a few things that are extremely noticeable.  

The first main component has been his unwavering mentality.  I joined the team in the middle/end push for the Ford Demo that was extremely stressful for vehicle ops.  He maintained a very calm demeanor throughout everything.  This was shown in the interactions with VOs, leads and engineers alike.  He shown a propensity for tackling these occurrences head on and fulfilling everything asked of him in a timely manner.  

The next major thing that I have seen has been his ability to help mentor the new leads; starting with me and continuing down the line with the Miami leads and finally with Mic.  He is always engaging and answers questions to the best of his abilities, regardless of whether the question is a good one or not.  He looks to make sure that the people under his tutelage are in face learning.  I feel a large part of my development was aided with Nuk making sure I understood what and why I was doing the things I was doing.  This made it easier to make connections quicker and get on board with the whole process faster than I would have ever expected. ",,,Ryan Schiffour,rschiffour@argo.ai,Anuruk Buranathanit,aburanathanit@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"One of my first Argo memories of your hard work and determination was when Brandon asked us to look into different scheduling software options - you immediately had multiple choices up and running to see the pros and cons of each, and put together a great presentation for the team to digest (gifs included).  The best part about this is that none of us were satisfied with those options so you took it upon yourself to build a great stop-gap to spin up scheduling and tracking of resources and missions.  I think that the effort you put forth in organization and planning in the beginning of this review period helped to set us all up for greater success as a team.

One of your greatest strengths is adapting to variables and ever-changing mission priorities.  I think you have done a great job of being quick to pivot and change the game plan at a moments' notice to prioritize important tests while keeping the entire VO fleet busy.  As you noted, I feel that you did an excellent job of keeping everyone not only busy, but learning, in the beginning when we had a ton of manual missions with questionable value other than training - this paid off in the end and made my job of AV training SO MUCH EASIER and ultimately allowed us to rack up AV miles much quicker.

I respect how much effort you've put into learning about the inner workings of the car, including spending a ton of time in the car yourself, to lead troubleshooting daily.  You absolutely lead by example and have never turned down a chance to hop into the driver seat when called upon, and this leads to even greater respect from those who you lead on a daily basis.  They understand that you are truly an expert in your field, not someone talking to them from behind a desk with no understanding of their current problems, and this is crucial in maintaining the amazing culture that we have built.

I think that your multitasking ability is off the charts.  In the morning you're juggling 20 VOs asking questions in person, telling you brick numbers to record, posting vehicle assignments, taking requests from fleet services, prioritizing the day's testing, and then leading a briefing before troubleshooting for all of those cars at the same time.  You do an excellent job of keeping up with all of that information and giving the attention required so that none of those things lags behind.  

It has been really exciting to see your progress over the past few months, and I can say without a doubt that we would not be in the same place without you at the helm for those early months.  You have had a huge part in building a culture of excellence among your VOs, and I admire your work - keep crushing it.",,,Steven Swartz,sswartz@argo.ai,Anuruk Buranathanit,aburanathanit@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Over the course of the most recent review cycle, I have been a part of facilitating and/or helping to facilitate daily testing with AV's and stock vehicles, various mapping/data collections of our old Moon test site, New Stanton and Pittsburgh, and coordinating the general day-to-day movement of the auto fleet and operators themselves.  At the earliest portion of the most recent review cycle, I felt that I was an important part of achieving our Q4 mileage push goal since the only AV certified drivers for Vehicle Ops at that point were a lead or Ops manager.  Leading up to our ""Debut"" night on public roads, I was part of the small team (small at that time, considering current size) that spent many hours testing different features and capabilities of the AV (Rabbits) at our Moon test site in order for us to progress to the point that our team was able to successfully hit the public roads in auto.

Since Vehicle Ops was mostly closed course auto (Moon test site) and only manual public road testing early on - we needed to keep our operators engaged and learning.  For this, one of the best things that could be done was to keep them familiar with the vehicles and ever changing AV system and UI.  This meant having to develop an abundance of manual routes and missions that would not only familiarize the operators with the city (many of our operators do not live in the city, and as such, aren't overly familiar with it), but also to expose them to many of the situations they would encounter while in auto.  I am unable to put into words how valuable I believe that time in the car prior to AV training was for them.  The transition the operators made from manual drivers to certified AV drivers was a quicker process than I have ever seen before, and I believe their exposure to and familiarity with the vehicles allowed them to be more comfortable and understand what they were seeing and feeling.  Our amazing trainers played a huge part in this, as they had been working their tails off to ensure we have confident and skilled operators behind the wheel.

To help manage and facilitate the vehicles, operators, and schedule for the day to day tasks/missions - I built the Mission Tracker spreadsheet.  This has since become (I think) our main manual tracking mechanism for recording mileage for the fleet, pre-ingest.  When operators slack their mileage totals for the shift, the Mission Tracker is where this lives (until ingest - then it can be viewed on a dashboard - but that takes time).  All tabs contain a week worth of fleet operation (M-F , but now starting to include Saturdays and Evenings).  Once the week has been completed, the sheet is hidden so that only the current week is displayed, but we are then able to go back through the tabs (if and when necessary) to dig up information that might have otherwise been harder to find.  (Who was in what car on what day...the mission they ran/any testing completed.) . I have since added a small script that will automatically add the Fleetio vehicle page to the Mission Tracker, depending on the vehicle being used.  It compares the range of pre-configured cells in a data input tab against the range of cells for any given day on the Mission Tracker.  Once it has a match, it imports the hyperlink into the main sheet.  This is much easier than always having Fleetio open and makes it quick to reference a specific vehicle.  (Super helpful when trying to look at inspection submissions, vehicle issues, comments, etc..) . This Mission Tracker (with the help of one of my counterparts, Dave Hart) has been revamped over time to include more items such as summaries and brick numbers for their vehicles, and also other cities where we are operating.

I made a spreadsheet to start tracking some of the issues we were seeing with the vehicles, as well as Ingest.  The MasterOps spreadsheet has since been taken over by the appropriate Ops Manager and is one of the mechanisms used to track what was ingested, when it was ingested, where the logs can be found, brick number and priority of the logs being ingested.  Issues are still tracked but now live in a different document that I believe was created by our Vehicle Reliability Manager, Rob.

I feel that I tend to collaborate and work well with others.  I  have bounced ideas or potential decisions off of my peers to see what they think.  This is also how I have acquired knowledge in different areas.  Working with such talented people that own a myriad of backgrounds in different disciplines, there is always another point of view that I haven't been exposed to.  

On a daily basis, I will troubleshoot on-demand.  Troubleshooting can be a daunting task at times, because technology does not always do what you want, when you want.  The troubleshooting typically will start once cars begin to roll out of Depot.  Some cars have easily resolved known issues, and sometimes others have issues that need to be escalated to our VRM.  Cars will slack in the issue(s) they're seeing.  I generally need some more context for the situation, since I am not physically in the vehicle to understand the exact circumstances of each and every issue.  Some issues may exhibit similar symptoms, but end up being two different problems.  Even with a video, I am only able to obtain so much information.  I generally use a series of follow-up questions in order to determine:

- What is the problem?
- Have we seen this before?
- What were you doing when this happened?  Where were you?
- If we haven't seen this issue before, grab as many pertinent details as possible. Alert the appropriate team member to this issue.  Add this issue to the proper spreadsheet, generate a ticket if necessary.
- For any issue, specifically known issues - fixing them on the fly is important to vehicle utilization/uptime.

Once gathering the necessary information - I can begin to narrow down the problem, based on the symptoms I am seeing and hearing via the Operator.  This allows me to quickly fix their problem (in most cases) so they can get back onto the road.  Getting cars back on the road/back onto mission is a huge part of us being able to progress toward our goals.  In some cases, troubleshooting can get to be quite extensive (trying to repeat a specific task crash, small edits to files, trying to discern between an AV System issue or vehicle related issue, etc..) . If necessary, I will recruit the help of other department members and org members when appropriate.

Dave or myself would typically handle the initial calls for incident response that would come in from a Vehicle Operator.  Depending on the nature and severity of the incident - I may also need to go on scene to help ensure operator safety as well as mitigate the excessive unwanted on-scene media attention that may ensue after an incident.  Given the fact that it's possible myself or another lead may not always be at the Depot or able to be reached for communication - there is a binder that I helped put together containing the numbers of all relevant personnel that should be notified.  In addition to the personnel numbers, the binder also includes contact information for our preferred contract tow companies and proper procedure and protocol for handling/running the shift in the absence of one of the shift leads.

Lisa and I have done several sessions of incident response with the vehicle operators.  This has already come in handy multiple times throughout the past few months - and not just for incidents.  A small part of the incident response procedure is knowing what to say and what not to say - in particular when it comes to members of the media or anyone trying to inquire about what did or did not happen.  A few days after doing one of my first few sessions, an operator included me and Lisa in a ""shout-out"" at end-of-shift - stating that without the training being provided, the operator may not have known how to handle the situation appropriately when confronted by the media in public.

I would like to say that I believe I have done well with prioritizing test requests, multitasking during all situations throughout the day, keeping safety at the forefront, and providing a positive and consistent approach to the job.  I helped to train our first VO I's for our Miami office - Dan and Marlon.  These were two people that came in with no industry experience.  Under the direction of our team and proper training, they were able to run a shift with little to no supervision from Myself, Dave or Ryan.  From an Operator standpoint, Steve and Lisa did a fantastic job at bringing them up to speed in such a short period of time.  I only had one previous experience of training a lead without prior industry experience - but it was a great opportunity for me to learn more about that aspect of the operation.  Through training Dan and Marlon, I again learned a great deal by way of experience and also observation.  You're able to see how the intricacies of the position are perceived by others - which better helps me to articulate the information in such a way that it will make sense and click for them.  Especially when there is a wealth of information - it can be difficult for someone to be able to absorb and compartmentalize all of it, while still trying to figure out heads or tails.  While the learning never stops, it's great to be able to have an impact on assisting others improve while I am simultaneously learning new things throughout the process also.",,,Anuruk Buranathanit,aburanathanit@argo.ai,Anuruk Buranathanit,aburanathanit@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"I would like to further my knowledge more in how some of the other teams are intertwined with VehOps - helping them is helping us.  I feel I have a pretty good understanding of the general structure currently, but it would be great to be able to gain more insight into what the teams do and how they work with each other.  I think this could help me to explain certain things at times when I'm caught off guard with questions from operators that I don't have an immediate answer to.  (Ex: What team is in charge of <insert plugin name>?   OR   How is the AV able to handle <insert situation> - or will we ever be able to handle <insert unique weather conditions/combinations>?)

For improvement - I am sure I can be better with communication.  Despite knowing how important this is across all facets, I do my best to stay on top of a plan for what needs done as far as what I am aware of, and for the most part, things won't often fall through the cracks very often.  Sometimes though, I will still forget to ask the right questions to the right people, which can consequently cause confusion and possible downtime.  Being more attentive at times is something I feel I can be better at, and should be easily and quickly achieved.

I would like to seek input of others more often than I tend to.  Sometimes (maybe a bad habit of not having a solid team around me at previous employers) I will try to do everything by myself.  I have to remember that none of us is as smart as ALL of us. We have a great team.  Part of being a leader on a great team is to be able to effectively and efficiently utilize the resources available to maximize the output of that team.  I am surrounded by brilliant people on a daily basis.  It would be wise to be picking their brains more often for ideas on certain aspects that include but are not limited to: testing, auto fleet, troubleshooting and issue reporting. At worst, I would gain a perspective or idea that could present itself as a primary or alternative option for one of the aforementioned items.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"The biggest area of improvement that I have seen is that occasionally communication can be lacking.  His ability to focus on getting a task complete can lead to information not getting disseminated to others that may have to have at least an idea of what is going on.   This has also led to somethings getting missed and having others get caught unaware of what is exactly going on.  

The next area is that the tunnel vision that can occur where instead of asking for help, Nuk will truck through and ""superhero"" it.  As vehicle ops continues to grow and accumulate great talent, the need for individuals to solo will decrease.  As that happens, having the trust and the ability to ask for help from the team is important. 

Overall I have witnessed someone that is eager to do whatever it is the team needs to accomplish our goals.  This leads to a bulldog mentality that has its benefits, but the occasional drawback as a peer.  ",,,Ryan Schiffour,rschiffour@argo.ai,Anuruk Buranathanit,aburanathanit@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"One way to improve over the next few months is efficiency, both monitoring the fleet's and improving your own.    
At the start of the period I felt that you were meticulous in ensuring assignments were created and posted before the start of the shift so that when VOs arrived they could get their cars started and hit the road directly after the meeting.  Recently they have had to wait longer to get their assignments, so we haven't been able to take advantage of their willingness to put forth extra effort in the mornings.  If you get back to that point of being better prepared for the day, I think that the fleet will have greater incentive to get out the door faster instead of casually waiting around to see what car they're in.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"During this cycle, I have been working in the Simulation team and RAD team. During this time I have involved in following major activities:

1) Cloud simulation 
I drove the implementation of the Cloud based simulation system from the beginning for the SimEng team. Working collaboratively with Lee Morris of Data team, I manage to create the V0 MVP to achieve 2017 Q4 org wide OKR. Then I spent time on stabilizing the system, introducing robust error handling, and improving the efficacy of the system. I worked collaboratively with the ADAF (then called MacDAF) lead author, Gus Atmeh to integrate ADAF to the cloud simulation system to obtain metrics. I authored documents to educate team members on the use of Cloud Simulation system. I regularly helped the users of the system to overcome challenges and asl identify bugs and fix them. I ensured relevant team leads are in-the-loop for the engineering decisions taken on the system that would effect how they use and look at the system. After kick-off of the JP team, I regularly worked with them to ensure their vision of the system is compatible with the users of the system. Also I worked with the JP team to ensure changes they are working on are not causing any regressions. Today, cloud simulation system is a regularly used tool to monitor the health of products made by MP-MC-SIM.

2) Mono-repo migration
During my time at RAD team, I was involved with Multi-repo to Mono-repo migration. Multi-repo had crippled the Argo Release process, to the point getting releases out was a agonizing multi-team effort. My contribution to this effort enabled the creation of smooth release process and a clean code repo. My contribution also resulted in a code repo that has unbroken history to the start of Argo org, a quality many multi-repo to mono-repo migrations lack. We were able perform this migration, on time and without a major disruption to work. 

3) Simulation City-Cordinate migration 
I converted the Simulator to use city-cordinate maps from UTM maps. This enabled Mapping to deprecate UTM maps as Simulation were the last users of such maps. This work included a significant code changes. I also managed to split 25000 line code change into manageable PR chucks to ensure code quality. 

4) SimLogger
Initially I wrote a derivative of the Core Logger task specifically for the Simulation. This enabled us to do single threaded logging until the Core Logger task could be adopted to the use in Simulation. Once the Infrastructure started work on the Logger Task conversion, I helped them with testing and advise to ensure Logger task did not break simulation or in car.

5) Helper scripts for Simulation users
I wrote Scenario Generator,  Map Downloader, and Scenario Map Downloader to ease the use of simulation. This enabled Simulation users to easily start using the simulation.

6) CLion maintenance 
CLion IDE is utilized by large amount of develops at Argo. I ensured they get timely updates by updating the Dockerfiles in collaboration with RAD team. Also I routinely help users to troubleshoot their problems in CLion. All this results in huge time savings to developers at Argo.

7) Provide infrastructure related support to SimEng team
Due to my experience with the infrastructure side of the codebase, I am able to help SimEng team members with infrastructure related troubleshooting. I also keep SimEng team members informed about status of the rest of the autonomy stack. ",,,Arjuna Ariyaratne,aariyaratne@argo.ai,Arjuna Ariyaratne,aariyaratne@argo.ai,Software,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"When Arjuna transferred to the simulation team last year he immediately started work on several features for simulation.  A major piece of that work was getting the simulation running as a nightly regression in the cloud.  Arjuna was responsible for getting the simulation running as a batch job in the cloud which involved working with the Lee and the Data/JP teams creating sim batch runs, loading maps, and generating results using ADAF evaluate system data and metrics generated by the simulation.  Arjuna continues to be one of the main SimEng team members to quickly triage and identify any issues that appear when running the simulation in the cloud.

To generate the logs needed for the system metrics the simulation needed to integrate the current core logger task into its framework.  Arjuna took the lead on that project by creating the sim logger task which was then replace by a modified core logger which he assisted the core team in applying simulation needs.

During the time working on cloud simulation the mapping team was developing the city map coordinate system. Initial implementation of the simulation was based on UTM coordinates and needed to migrate to the city map coordinate frame.  Arjuna took responsibility for migrating all of the simulation components and configurations from UTM to city coordinates.  The migration of the simulation code and scenarios went smoothly and any issues were quickly resolved.

Arjuna is also the go to person on the sim team to triage any issues with the simulation docker.  On several occasions base images were updated without updating the simulation and Arjuna was there to quickly triage and issue and work with other teams to get it resolved.   

Arjuna has also taken it upon himself to be the maintainer of Clion, which is the IDE that many of the developers in argo use.  He is continuously managing updates and offering suggestions on integrating the IDE with our code base.

Arjuna continues to familiarize himself with the simulation architecture and had added several features to the simulation from exposing existing parameters to configuration for STS to adding additional behaviors to movers in the simulation.",,,Tom Ackenhausen,tackenhausen@argo.ai,Arjuna Ariyaratne,aariyaratne@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"- Cloud Simulation
Arjuna drove the implementation of the Cloud based simulation system, working collaboratively with Lee Morris of the Data team. This in my opinion was one of the highest impact accomplishments from the end of 2017 that now allows us to easily run batch jobs in the cloud to test for regressions (both at the time of a PR, as well as for nightly regression checks on develop).

- Simulation City-Coordinate migration
Prior to the city-coordinate migration, most tests preformed in simulation needed to be on UTM maps. This meant that as the AV migrated to city coordinate map usage, mapping would need to create a UTM version of this same map for use in simulation. By migrating over to city coordinates in simulation, this alleviated mapping from needing to maintain these extra UTM maps. Arjuna was one of the key members on the SimEng team to ensure this transition went smoothly maintaining a ridiculously large PR chain (since it needed to land simultaneously) which was broken into manageable chunks.

- Helper scripts for Simulation users
Arjuna wrote several scripts which made life easier for scenario creators to accelerate their progress.

- CLion maintenance
Arjuna is the key member which helps to maintain CLion at Argo, an IDE which many developers use. Also he is very active in helping users of this interface to ensure others are getting the most out of CLion when problems arise.

- Provides infrastructure related support to SimEng team
Arjuna is the go-to person for the SimEng team when any infrastructure issues come up -- helping all other members work through any issues they see.

Arjuna regularly takes on efforts that would normally be given to someone with with a senior software engineering level due to the level of difficulty and risk.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Since I joined in January coming in with Windows development experience I was able to quickly ramp up with Linux development stack, proprietary libraries and macros used in Argo C++ code base and became proficient writing and debugging code that adheres to coding best practices at Argo.

During my first task of adapting LoggerTask to simulation use case I identified and fixed previously unnoticed bugs related to LoggerTask not shutting down correctly and dropping messages on shutdown. The result was a LoggerTask that is fully deterministic and suitable for simulation usage. When working on diagnostics utilities I successfully instrumented other teams code to enable latency monitoring and have written MessageSpy utility.

Working closely with Niko and with minimal supervision I designed the Car OS requirements and implementation details from ground up utilizing best industry practices used in large IoT deployments. I have built an automated build framework that uses version controlled inputs and virtualization to enable one command build that goes from ISO file download to producing a customized set of disk images for every car node published in artifactory and ready for deployment. The framework is robust to the changes to the number of car nodes and allows easy visibility of changes being made to the OS.

To increase speed when making changes to the OS I introduced automated virtualized testing framework that mimics network setup on the car, instantiates 3 virtual car nodes and enables testing of deployment scripts without running them on real car. Once SSH key storage issues is resolved, this same testing can be done in CI enabling previously impossible validation of deployment scripts.

When evaluating OS deployment strategy I noticed it is slow and requires significant human effort to input commands to deploy image on each car node, monitor the process and do this sequentially for each car node realistically taking several hours to complete. I introduced the new deployment framework that creates automated bootable environment on USB drive, copies disk image automatically once booted, adjusts the boot order if necessary, repartitions the hard drive and deploys the image. The new process can work fully unattended once 1 time boot order change is complete on the cars and subsequent reflashes could be done in under 15 minutes if done in parallel on all 3 car nodes. Aside from addressing OS image updates initiated by software organization this new deployment process also improves the time consuming process of first time vehicle configuration or re-initialization after repairs. Once fleet scales to a large number of vehicles this would offer increasing benefits to teams that manage the fleet.

I took responsibility for smooth deployment, became the go to person for Car OS rollout issues, worked with team members in Pittsburgh, Dearborn and Miami depots, ensured teams have required tools and documentation and provided ongoing support both in person in Pittsburgh and on the “FMC rollout” channel on slack.

One of the nice side effects of deploying the new OS is reduced boot time. Taking 4:51 to boot, percy currently takes 3:16 for SSH server to become available which is a 33% improvement saving engineers time every day.

During Car OS development I became proficient writing bash scripts and learned common GNU tools which I haven’t used before developing on Windows platform. I am now very comfortable reviewing other people’s bash pull requests. While bash is great for writing shorter scripts, thinking back, Python would have been a better choice to implement more complex logic in build scripts, only leaving OS modification steps written in bash. I would like to become more proficient with Python to and make this one of the major goals for the upcoming 6 months.

Arsenii is a great communicator, always looking at new perspectives and adapting people's comments into his implementations. In code reviews Arsenii provides clear advice while taking the time to understand your perspective so you're not pressured into doing his way. When receiving advice, Arsenii makes a genuine effort to look into your suggestion often taking it a step farther to even teach you something.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"I am not sure where to start...Ashely is AWESOME!!!

From the day that Ashley walked through the doors of the Clark Building, she has been willing to help with whatever needs to be done.  She pitched in to help stand up a new office.  Once the office was up and running she participated in the process to improve the space and the functionality of Argo at the Crane Building.  Ashley worked to refine and improve many aspects of the space and the organization.  Literally, whatever she was/is asked to do, she did/does!

It has been great to see Ashley grow in her role as Executive Assistant to the CEO.  When Ashley first took on this role, she was nervous.  It has been great to see her build such a great rapport with Bryan and to really understand what he needs and wants!  With this role has come a sense of confidence in Ashley's decision making.  

Ashley is clearly the go to when you are trying to find time on Bryan's calendar or to figure out when and where you can catch him for a quick question.  But she is more than a person who keeps his calendar.  She appears to make Bryan's life better.  There is a trust between the two and she works so hard to make sure that she can foresee his needs and works to make sure that he is prepared for his day.

I have been fortunate to have worked closely with her from the beginning and I can truly say that Ashley has grown tremendously over the past year!  Ashley not only works to support Bryan but the organization as a whole.  She is forward thinking and makes suggestions to the other teams that improve the organization overall.  She has worked with IT to include pictures of conference rooms on the locator tool so that you can see when you are scheduling a room what it looks like and how it is set up.  This was a great improvement!  

Ashley ends up supporting the entire leadership team and many others.  She is always professional and always available...she and I exchange emails pretty regularly after hours and on the weekends!  Ashley is dedicated to her work and it shows in the results.  

I believe that Ashley is requesting a promotion in this round of performance reviews.  I would not only support this promotion completely but encourage it!  Ashley has not only had sustained successful contributions but she has truly grown in her role at Argo and in her professional experience!",,,Kelly Mullins,kmullins@argo.ai,Ashley Waller,awaller@argo.ai,General & Administrative,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"I believe that you will find that the information below strongly supports my promotion from a level 3 to a level 4 executive assistant:

**Notable Contributions and Organizational Impact**

During my first six months at Argo, the company was smaller and I stepped in to fill many roles across a variety of departments, including purchasing, facilities, and people operations. As departments companywide have expanded, I have been able to focus more on my Executive Assistant duties and growing my responsibilities within this role. One notable expansion of my responsibilities has been overseeing Argo’s community outreach and sponsorships. As the main point of contact for these requests since September 2017, I have set up donations to 11 organizations, organized research funds for 3 visiting scientists, and coordinated 9 community outreach events. There was no infrastructure in place for community outreach and sponsorships, and I determined how best to organize the incoming requests by creating the tracking spreadsheet and filing system we use today. Given that this was my first experience with community outreach, I consider it a significant achievement to have created a streamlined method for tracking our participation in community outreach and sponsorships. This tracking will make it easier to highlight specific instances where Argo has supported our community in future discussions with local political leaders and universities. Taking ownership of community outreach allows me to be a more impactful EA by offering an additional avenue for protecting Bryan’s time by allowing him to remain distant from the detailed planning and tracking of these events. 

I also created a preparation process for the all hands meetings. It became clear that no one was sure who owned the various responsibilities associated with preparing for the all hands meetings, which include tracking who was approved to dial in, locking the dial-in, and testing the meeting slide deck. I stepped in and clarified the division of responsibilities by creating a spreadsheet that tracks who is responsible for each task, along with a designated back-up for each person, and distributed this spreadsheet to IT at each Argo office and to those involved in preparing the all hands slide deck. This has contributed to the all hands meetings being coordinated effectively and efficiently, ensuring that all and only approved participants can dial in, the meetings start on time, and that Bryan’s time spent in these meetings is as productive as possible.

While scheduling a media interview with Bryan at our Dearborn office, I realized that many Argo employees may not be familiar with the layout of conference rooms at offices other than their home office. Since room layouts can be better (or worse) for certain types of meetings, I determined it would be useful to have photos of each conference room readily accessible by all Argo employees. I worked with IT to have photos added to the floor plan mapper.  This ensures that employees book the conference room best suited for their meeting, prevents inefficient, last-minute scrambles to find a more suitable room, and helps meetings run more smoothly.

I have also been able to improve efficiency by tracking when the executives I am assisting have back-to-back meetings and booking those meetings in the same conference rooms, in order to reduce the amount of unnecessary shuffling between rooms. For example, I noticed that Brett has several recurring weekly update meetings that include the same attendees at different locations. These meetings were split up throughout the day, and each meeting was scheduled in a different conference room in each location. I re-scheduled these meetings to be back-to-back and adjusted the rooms so that none of the attendees at any of the locations had to switch rooms between these meetings. For particularly busy executives at risk of missing meetings due to their crowded schedule, I changed the scheduling procedure to arrange meetings in whatever room they will be in at that time -- bringing the meeting to them -- instead of requiring them to remember the meeting (or requiring others to go remind them) and move to another room. This maximizes their time and helps to ensure that all meetings are held on schedule. I’ve received thanks from several TPMS for streamlining the process and avoiding wasted time and movement between conference rooms.

In another effort to help maximize Bryan’s time, I have begun tracking a list of requested meetings for Bryan in a given geographic location, along with the availability of those requesting the meetings. From there, can plan ideal windows for him to travel in which he can hold as many of these meetings as possible. For instance, at different points in time Bryan had been asked to meet with media, various external companies, and provide a demo ride for the Investor Relations team in Dearborn. I kept track of everyone’s availability for each of the requested meetings and determined a three-day window where Bryan could travel to Dearborn and hold all of the requested meetings within one trip. In addition, I also suggested travel times to minimize the amount of work Bryan had to put into planning the trip.

Since Traci’s departure on April 12th, I have also made a significant organizational impact by assisting Pete and Brett in addition to Bryan. In taking on these additional EA responsibilities, I ensured that Pete and Brett continued to have attentive EA support. They have been able smoothly transition to relying on me for help with booking travel, scheduling meetings, booking conference rooms, shuffling meetings on their calendars to maximize time and efficiency, and other EA responsibilities. I have received encouraging praise from leadership for the quality of support I have been able to provide since Traci’s departure.

Lastly, to help Bryan be well-prepared for upcoming meetings I have started to gather a list of notable meetings for the upcoming week that I share with Bryan at the end of the previous week, along with any relevant information about those meetings. I initiated this practice not only to help Bryan prepare for the week ahead, but also because it creates another prompt for him to note any upcoming meetings that he would like to reschedule. This has been put on hold since I began assisting Brett and Pete, but will resume as soon as Kara (Pete and Brett’s new EA) arrives.

**Communication**

Level 4 on the job ladder indicates that I should be able to communicate effectively and efficiently, whereas a level 3 EA should be working to develop skills to communicate more effectively and efficiently. I believe that a good example of my ability to communicate at a Level 4 is the role I played in lobbying for increased nonstop flights between the Bay Area and Pittsburgh. Bryan had been in contact with other leaders of tech companies, as well as the Pittsburgh airport, in an effort to increase the number of direct flights between Pittsburgh and the Bay area. I worked with representatives from the various tech companies to arrange a meeting to plan how to reach out to the various airlines in order to suggest an increase in direct flights (or the start of direct flights at all, for most airlines). The outcome of the meeting was that each company would contact selected airlines by email, mail, and phone to convince them of the need for additional flights. Isobel and I were tasked with reaching out to the airlines on behalf of Argo. This included editing a letter template to be sent to the airlines and cold-calling the identified airline contacts. Part of the information Isobel and I needed to estimate and share with the airlines was how many additional flights we believed Argo employees would take if there was additional nonstop service. I gathered what data I could on flights Argo has taken between Pittsburgh and the Bay Area and estimated the expected increase in flights taken over the next few years, on the assumption that additional nonstop service was offered, along with the estimated total cost of those additional flights. I also spoke with the head of the Pittsburgh Airport to try to gather additional data that the airlines requested. As a result of the combined efforts by various tech companies in the Pittsburgh area, United Airlines increased their nonstop service between Pittsburgh and the Bay Area by adding: 
year-round non-stop service between PIT and SFO (previously only offered 10 months a year),
a seasonal second daily flight to SFO from PIT (operates from June - October 2018). 
Many of the Mountain View teams have expressed excitement at the additional flights, which has had a significant impact on travel between the Bay Area and Pittsburgh. These additional flights not only impact our current employees, but also may help recruiting bring candidates from the Bay Area into the Pittsburgh office.

Being Bryan’s executive assistant allows me the opportunity to interface with people in a variety of professional positions. This requires me to understand who my audience is when communicating both internally and externally. I have continually been trusted to handle communications and to personally meet and greet high-level executives at Ford including Bill Ford, Jim Hackett, and Jim Farley, as well as important figures in the Pittsburgh community such as Mayor Peduto’s office, University Deans, and the Pittsburgh International Airport. My communications with these individuals and organizations have ranged from coordinating meetings, travel, and demo rides for Ford executives, to organizational details related to Mayor Peduto’s visit to Argo’s company party, to coordinating highly sensitive meetings with external companies. I have also been trusted to organize visits to Argo for several professors including Sanja Fidler and James Hays, the latter of which is now a visiting scientist with Argo. 

One further example of how I have continued to be an effective and efficient communicator is my independent creation and maintenance of calendar conflict spreadsheets. These not only show a list of all of the conflicts that need to be addressed each week, but also my recommendation for how to correct them. Communicating calendar conflicts in this way identifies upcoming conflicts before they become crises, and including my suggested resolutions reduces the need for repeated communications with executives and frees up time they would otherwise have to spend determining how to resolve scheduling conflicts.

**Team Work**

During the hiring process for our future executive assistant, it was proving difficult to assess the skills needed for this role during the interview process. Argo had a homework assignment that had been used for past searches, though it was more finance-focused than perhaps necessary for this role. I worked with Isobel to create a new homework assignment that targeted the skills most important for an EA candidate. We were able to build on each other’s ideas and respective talents to determine a set of core EA skills and create a homework assignment that tests those skills: communication, organization, problem-solving, and time management. This homework assignment is now being used as part of the executive assistant hiring process.

Amy and I took on an improvement project of a different character: we teamed up to create an aesthetically pleasing, well-organized, efficient kitchen setup for the Pittsburgh office that could also easily be recreated in other offices. We took a “divide and conquer” approach, splitting the work into purchasing and setup. Once the improvements were made, we received many compliments from employees in Pittsburgh as well as from other locations, and we were able to have a similar setup created in Dearborn.  I have also worked with the facilities team on several other tasks. For instance, we worked together to create the 3 Crossings Move presentation for a Pittsburgh all hands meeting. Amy was out of the office for the week we were originally tasked with creating the slide deck for this presentation, so I worked with the real estate, finance, and recruiting teams and with Moss Architecture to gather the information I thought people would be interested to know about the new office space. The presentation date ended up being pushed back and Amy and I were able to collaborate on creating the deck for the presentation. 

I have also been able to help Argo by re-arranging meeting locations (or even times) for other employees to free up a conference room, often for large meetings, when no conference rooms are available. Since conference room space at most Argo locations is in high demand, there is a need for someone to fill this role throughout the day. I help out the Argo team by determining the room size needed for the requested meeting, which conference rooms require the least amount of disruption to make available, and then reach out to the individuals booked in that room to suggest other arrangements to free up the room. Though not exactly within my job description as an EA, I realize how time consuming this can be for other employees and am happy to help limit the amount of time they spend on tasks like these.

**Leadership**

I am often the go-to for other employees when they need help finding something, locating the right person to contact for a given issue, or want to determine whether their question can be answered without going directly to leadership. I have also become a go-to for help with GSuite programs. I have taught many employees how to do things like sharing calendar access, more efficient ways to search for people's availability, how to add conference rooms to an event, and so on. A recurring example of teaching my fellow team members was helping Traci with Gsuite. For instance, I spent considerable time helping her, both with basic skills and teaching her tips and tricks to speed up her work. She knew I was very comfortable with Google Calendar and could always come to me for help. I also taught Traci how to use several features of Google Maps to better estimate travel time for Pete and Brett when I noticed she was having difficulty with that.

My ownership of community outreach has also offered me leadership opportunities. For instance, I organized a student visit to our depot in Pittsburgh in December 2017. I worked with Sharon Gaitens, a teacher from a local school who wanted to have her gifted students visit Argo to learn about AV technology. I coordinated with Sharon from October 2017 up to the day of the visit to organize a fun and educational day for the students. In addition to working with Sharon on the logistics of having 50 students, between ages 6-11, and 8 parents visit our depot with Sharon, I also recruited several volunteers from Argo to participate in the event. After the event, I received the following note from Sharon: “I am very appreciative of your help!  You have been so wonderful to work with over the past few months.” 

In addition to coordinating community outreach, I also check on the likelihood of media being present at events people from Argo will be attending. If media may be present, I ensure that Alan Hall and Bryan are aware of this and that an employee that has been through media training will be present. To aid in this process, I have a created a list of people who have gone through training and the date they went through the training.

In sum, I believe my performance makes a strong case that I have been consistently operating as a L4 Executive Assistant for the duration of this review period.",,,Ashley Waller,awaller@argo.ai,Ashley Waller,awaller@argo.ai,General & Administrative,

She does it all, and does it very well and most of the time seemingly instantaneously.  Pete and Brett commented what a relief it had been getting support from Ashley --- things just happened faster and more efficiently with fewer defects along the way.  Ashley without a doubt is working independently and with the expertise and leadership I expect at the next level.  She is deserving of a promotion for as a reward for the incredible support she gives our exec team day in and day out.  Ashley has sacrificed her own personal time over and over again to make sure we're set up to be successful, no matter if we're on travel or in the office - Ashley is on top of it ALWAYS.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"It is a privilege and pleasure to work with Ashley.

Any time she comes to the facilities team with a request, Ashley has complete details of what is needed, thereby making it easier to fulfill what is asked.  (Cases in point:  multiple instances of coordinating catering for special events/ meetings.  Ashley provides guidance for timing and delivery, quantity & budgets, food preferences & dietary concerns, which can streamline the ordering & invoicing process with Fabled Table.  If there are questions about availability and/or feasibility, she is open to hearing suggestions and alternatives from me and others in order to improve service.)  On the flipside, Ashley has been just as accommodating whenever I've gone to her for scheduling assistance or room booking shuffles.

Beyond the day-to-day, Ashley shows great care toward Argo visitors and sets an example we all should follow.  Ashley consistently opens doors, greets our guests by name, and pays attention to little details that have big impacts as they make lasting, positive impressions.

The biggest way she made an impression on me is just as much personal as it is professional.  Ashely checked in with me everyday while I struggled with the loss of my friend in January.  She listened to the heartbreaking stories about hospice and helped me laugh because she knew I needed those moments of release.

In the week after Maria's funeral, I was tasked to give a 3 Crossings presentation during a mini-all hands.  Without Ashley's support, this would not have come together.  She helped to gather floor plans and images from Moss, organize information for the slides, and display fabric, tile, and flooring samples that were dropped off at the office.  Her support to make this happen when I was clearly struggling was the epitome of teamwork.

I'm incredibly thankful for Ashley's partnership.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"I am naturally one to want to help whenever and wherever I can. While this is an important trait for someone in a support role, it can also lead to taking on too much work and put myself at risk of missing deadlines. I would like to continue to improve my ability to know when taking on additional work is unreasonable and to set realistic expectations for myself for response times and overall workload. For example, initially when taking on the assistant duties for Brett and Pete, I set the same expectations for myself that I would normally have when I am assisting Bryan solely. I quickly learned that I needed to set limits and prioritize tasks. Through this experience, I ultimately learned that it is acceptable to say “I’m sorry I can’t help right now,” or that I will need additional time to complete something. I would like to continue to learn how to maintain high, but achievable expectations for myself, so I can be a better and more productive team member. 

I would also like to work on finding more ways to improve my time management skills. While part of my job is keeping others organized and on schedule, I sometimes let my own schedule fall by the wayside, which has caused me to be late to 2 meetings. In an effort to improve in this area, I have started setting prep time on my calendar before important meetings as an additional reminder to prepare for the meeting.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Since I have started here, I have shown my ability to work across the system and to come up to speed in areas that I previously had little to no domain knowledge.  From starting out in Localization and Visualization work, to ending up working on algorithmic work for Tracking, I have had timely, critical impact on goals for the company.  I have also shown to be able to work with different teams and to have significant impact on the timely delivery of OKRs.

Knowledge and Technical Skill
On localization, one of my areas of responsibility was developing the debugging visualizations to help understand issues with the localization stack.  This included making 10 different visualization plugins to debug and understand the performance of the localization system for which I am still responsible.   These visualizations are still being used to debug the localization system when issues come up.  These plugins continue to be used today to debug and diagnosis localization issues quickly and efficiently.  
 
Found a performance improvement in scan matcher that allowed it to run fast enough to run on vehicle.  The improvement was a 10x reduction in runtime for the scan matcher.  

I was also instrumental in landing bootstrapping for the vehicles.   My responsibilities were working with Ben X on the initial design and moving it into a production ready system.  This was committed and tested only a week after the planned finished time, even though code red occurred which caused multiple disruptions.  The first test that I performed on vehicle for bootstrapping was successful and after that the feature flag was changed to always use bootstrapping. There were no more changes to the underlying bootstrap code through Q1.  The bootstrapping feature allowed for the unblocking of all non-applanix vehicles. 

Near the end of Q1, I added support for quick bootstrapping which has become a favorite among VOs and others who routinely use the cars.

During my short time on the VIZ team at the end of Q4, I was responsible for getting all plugins 3D capable, except for the tracking plugins.  This consisted of working across the software groups to convert plugins that assumed a 2D world into ones that would draw in either a 2D or 3D world.  This also required filling in an interface and extracting ground surface data from ply files.  Along with that work I also made a large portion of the display primitives capable of being draped over the ground surface. These features were delivered on time for the Q4 video. 

I diagnosed the tracking issue that caused code red and created an initial patch.  Also during code red I took on making sure that log playback was playing back messages in order.

On tracking, I was responsible for making improvements to tracking quality while maintaining reasonable run time for the Ford demonstration at the end of Q1.  For this, I made multiple algorithmic updates including adding a new data association layer, and getting the registration to track shape models when the car rotates.  I also implemented the fading and eternal shape models.   Along with this, I was responsible for creating the debugging visualization which helped developers understand what the underlying registration and ekf were doing for each track.  This visualization has been indispensable for understanding tracking issues and regressions.  It is the go to source for debugging the tracker.  Throughout this process, I created video updates to keep management informed of current progress towards the OKR goals.  This large body of work was accomplished in 4-5 weeks of work with steady progress being made throughout the time. During this time, I also became comfortable with performing integration tests of tracking on the vehicle.  This has allowed me to take roll in testing tracking changes live on vehicle before landing them in develop.  I earned the respect of team members during this time that has led me to being sought after for advice on software changes to the tracking stack. 

I also became a C++ reader.

Organizational Impact
Since I started at Argo, I have been moved onto teams to help them achieve their hard deadlines (I have really enjoyed this aspect of Argo).  On localization, I created debugging visualizations and found performance improvements that were instrumental in getting the autonomous millage OKR for the end of Q4.  Before Q4 ended, I moved over and helped visualization get a polished video out the door to help show off Argo’s work in the best possible light.  After Q4, I was moved back to localization where I worked on freeing the non applanix fleet by delivering bootstrapping along with Ben X. After this, I was moved to Tracking and was a significant contributor towards the Q1 Tracking OKR and the end of Q1 demonstration.   

Communication
I have had a few opportunities to show off my communication skills during this last review period.  I worked on leading the creation of a few design docs for tracking, including the tracking V3 design doc.  I also worked on documentation for the VO’s when bootstrapping landed.  Outside of that, I have helped the company communicate to its investors through producing videos for both the end of Q4 and shiny videos at the end of Q1 which received rave reviews from management.  During Q1 I was involved in making multiple videos to communicate current tracking improvement progress to management and others in the company.

Team Work
I have been shown to be a team player.  I have worked on a variety of different teams and was  able to make large contributions.  This would not have been possible without good communication.  I am able to engage in discussions with team members and through the discussions arrive at compromises that achieve the best possible decisions.  It takes a team player and communicator to be able to have these discussions and not leave either person bent out of shape at the end of them.

Outside of the teams I have operated in, I actively work with other teams.  I have worked with AI, test ops, and VOs.  I have represented my team well when working with these groups.

Leadership
I have become the go to person for debugging tracking problems in the fleet, and for other tracking related questions.  While my technical understanding is not as deep as others on the team, my system level understanding and how the tracker interacts with other systems is very good.  I use these abilities to triage the questions and get the correct person answering them if the question is not something I either know yet or if they are looking for more details than I am able to provide.


Through the accomplishments stated above I believe I have shown that I am comfortable working on and completing high impact work on strict timelines across many different aspects of the AV system.  I have been able to jump into different groups, win team member’s respect, and be a strong force for contributing to multiple teams’ successes.  On localization, tools to debug the system were a significant improvement, and a productivity multiplier to the team.  No longer was debugging done just by text output, but by seeing the data in the world that the AV works in.  On visualization, I added critical features to help show off company successes in the best possible light for the end of Q4.  I reprised parts of this roll for making another video in the end of Q1 for similar purposes.   On tracking, I was instrumental on adding tools to understand how the algorithm was working and on adding improvements to make the tracker stable enough for the Q1 demonstration.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Ben has been working with multiple teams on several projects, including visualization of localization and tracking system, localization bootstrapping, regression framework, etc. He is a very experience robotics engineer, and his work rate is amazing, Ben is the reason why localization and tracking team were able to deliver product on time in a very tight schedule. He also makes amazing videos! I am mostly impressed by Ben's attitude and work ethic. As Ben codes twice as fast as I do, he is constantly offering help and eager to take on more projects, and he always follows through. Ben's work is certainly exceeding the expectation of a Senior Engineer. ",,,Ben Xinjilefu,xxx@argo.ai,Ben Ballard,bballard@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Ben worked for me when I was leading localization. Unfortunately for Ben he was great at making visualization tools. He churned out quality tools at a ridiculous speed. These tools helped identify issues and validate the localization system.

He then got moved onto the visualization team and was responsible for the handling of pose in our visualization system. After talking to people on the localization team as well as others in visualization and MP he became the expert on the issue. He created and implemented a system that unified and made sense of the fragmented and broken way we were handling pose in viz before.

Ben also owned bootstrapping for localization. An area outside of his domain but he was able to implement the system and integrate it on vehicle with little issue.

Ben was great in code red and found some of the key issues that were plaguing the tracking team. He was on localization at the time and was still able to jump in and give significant help to another team. Also, note that localization isn't Ben's area of expertise either, but we needed strong engineers to bail that team out and he did a great job in helping to do that.",,,Rob Keelan,rkeelan@argo.ai,Ben Ballard,bballard@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Due to my limited time at the company, I wish to focus my review on Ben's work on tracking, as well as his qualities as a coworker at Argo.  While I am not a member of the tracking team, prediction consumes tracking messages and therefore developing a close working relationship with Ben has been central to my work.

During my first two months at Argo, I watched Ben (and other Ben) work incredibly hard on our tracking algorithm, and I also saw our incoming tracking messages get a whole lot better.  Velocities became more accurate and stable.  Segmentation errors occurred less and less frequently, and we are suddenly able to implement prediction logic that simply wouldn't have been possible in February.  In addition to the impressive output of his work, I have admired and learned from Ben's constant communication.  He is transparent and forthright about the state of tracking on a daily basis.  He is never deterred by a step sideways or backward, he always displays a clear and accurate picture of trackings current capabilities and failure modes.  I think his work and his communication was central to the success of the Ford demo.  Post demo, I have seen that same level of communication in quickly investigating AI issues.  In addition to the work listed in his own review, Ben has been laying a lot of groundwork for a proper testing and regression framework for both tracking and prediction.  It will be of massive importance going forward.

Beyond the lines of code he writes, Ben is an incredibly good coworker.  He has played a central role in getting me up to speed both formally (as in the case of interview training) and informally (helping me find and configure viz tasks, answer basic questions, etc.).  He is perpetually cheerful, even when swamped with highest priority work.  It takes a unique skill set to have taken up as many roles within Argo as he has and the resulting breadth of knowledge in one engineer is extremely valuable.

Despite being very positive person, Ben has an ambitious dissatisfaction with elements of our workflow, algorithms, and infrastructure that prevent the Argo AV from being where it could be.  His combination of good intuition and constant communication leads to a kind of beneficial impatience which,  in my opinion, is driving Argo in the right direction.  ",,,Andrew Hartnett,ahartnett@argo.ai,Ben Ballard,bballard@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Ben drove to completion several key projects this cycle in the areas of localization, critical to getting others unblocked.  These were related to visualization and bootstrapping.

He was the one that hooked localization into the visualization system.  This was key to getting accurate and constructive feedback about how the system was performing.  He continued to expand it and add more and more features.  Between the scan matcher and the pose filter debugging interface, Ben has exposed many great diagnostic signals to user which have proven to be very beneficial.

Ben created the initial cut of the bootstrapping system.  This was one of key localization pieces that jump started the system at startup.  Allowing us to operate out on the street and to start the car from unknown positions.  As the system grew, even though he moved to a different team, he continued to offer support on how it worked and guidance on how it could be improved.  Not just in a surface level way, but by also providing the conceptual framework with which to understand why decisions were made the way they were. 

He is approachable and has always made a real effort to help me when I come to him with questions.  Like when I was having trouble understanding how the bootstrapping system worked, he agreed to an early morning meeting just so I could pick his brain about how it worked and how I could modify it.  That meeting not only cleared up many questions but helped to give a greater context as  to how the system worked.

He has good insight and is forward thinking as well.  When I spoke with him about he deterministic localization system he immediately commented on how it could be applied to provide a metric based understanding of how dense our maps need to be.  That was great a long term plan that hadn't even occurred to me.",,,Brendan Byrne,bbyrne@argo.ai,Ben Ballard,bballard@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"* Delivers critical capability in mission critical scenarios with reliability. Localization work required landing large new features which the entire system relies on for operating at scale. This includes both onboard features (e.g. bootstrapping) and developer features (e.g. debugging and visualization tools).
* Identified cases where problems needed to be addressed at larger scales, and pushed for approaches to change to meet these requirements. For localization, this meant implementing visualization and debug systems for allowing developers to understand internal operations in a process that was reproducible across multiple logs more easily. This happened again in tracking, where the development process was focused on testing at a small scale, and advocated for shifting to larger scale regression and log analysis tooling. Another example is in pushing for more rigorous and detailed design documents when issues in tracking or localization have appeared, both in the process of solving problems encountered, and in helping others solve problems. This work demonstrated an ability to communicate and work with a team in a professional fashion, as well as steering effort towards principled practices that scale better and reduce technical debt down the road.
* Dedicated worker, who puts in the hours to do things right, and pushes for best practices in testing new code. Has been a strong advocate for increasing testing and metrics for ensuring robust performance, both in communicating with others, and in leading by example and testing code on vehicle regularly.
* Demonstrates an ability to work across a broader range of technical domains in the software system, and make positive contributions in each of them. Shifting between localization, visualization, and tracking requires a broad range of knowledge, and an ability to adapt to new technical spaces. More importantly, is willing to handle the churn of shifting gears to contribute to a variety of teams, and is able to apply insights from one domain to another with positive results.
* Cares about improving the quality of both individual contributions and managing technical debt through improving best practices and processes. This is reflected in engaging in discussions about these topics with team members, working to balance considerations, and take the results of these discussions and apply them at larger scales. I've personally had many discussions about best practices in C++ which have been pushed to code reviews to improve code beyond personal contributions.",,,Jason Ziglar,jziglar@argo.ai,Ben Ballard,bballard@argo.ai,Software,

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,Ben get's thrown at a lot of hard problems in areas outside of his domain. I don't think additional system ownership is feasible given how much he is already doing. I would like to see him get more involved across other teams. He has a lot of great insight that isn't being spread to the rest of the org and as a result he doesn't have the impact that he could.,,,Rob Keelan,rkeelan@argo.ai,Ben Ballard,bballard@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"Tracking items through to completion is one of the areas that I could improve upon.  The tracking throw that I found during code red had a underlying cause that was not fully understood and assessed until near the end of Q1.  If I had followed the issue through the code further, I would have found the exploding search size earlier as the underlying bug that caused code red. 

I probably spend more time than required or necessary updating management on the status of the state of my work and emergent issues.  I have noticed recently that I update my manager on a daily or every other day basis about my current status, and I really should work towards a more efficient process to communicate with my manager.

Balancing priorities is also an area to improve upon.  Currently in tracking there are many priorities from emergent issues from the fleet to long term regression testing goals.  All of these need worked on for the next year to be successful.  Finding a better way to prioritize issues should help me work quicker through the issues that have the largest impact on the company.

As I mentioned above, Ben has this ambitious dissatisfaction with the status quo, which I really think drives us forward.  He wants to see things done right and done ASAP.  His experience on several different teams allows him to see and identify both possibilities and pain points that I would have missed.  My hunch, however, is that Ben could improve marginally in prioritizing what needs to get changed, improved, and implemented today, vs. what can function with band-aids in the short term.",,,Andrew Hartnett,ahartnett@argo.ai,Ben Ballard,bballard@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,I think Ben gave a very self aware assessment of growth areas.  I haven't had any interactions with him that made me feel like he wasn't in complete control of what was happening. But I do agree with him that I think he can be even more independent.  Ben has great technical skills and seems more than competent to be working for long stretches with losing impact.  But this can only be achieve if one has a solid understanding of where they need to go.  So if he thinks that he can be more a efficient communicator and that it'll give him firm direction then I'd support that as an area for growth.,,,Brendan Byrne,bbyrne@argo.ai,Ben Ballard,bballard@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"* Taking on larger scale projects either as a technical leader, or as the primary contributor to a larger feature. I believe Ben is already capable of doing this, but this would serve both increasing the impact of solid hands in the system, as well as building technical capital for increased impact.
* Continuing to refine knowledge of best practices and judgement, and how best to apply these. Many discussions about the causes/issues in Code Red, as well as design discussions, have demonstrated good instincts for best practices and when information is lacking. Finding more opportunities to convert these discussions to action can serve to increase impact.",,,Jason Ziglar,jziglar@argo.ai,Ben Ballard,bballard@argo.ai,Software,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Bill is an electrical engineer with specialty in high frequency RF.  He is a self-starter and generally takes high-level direction.  From this he typically develops any required circuit design and test plan for characterization or verification.  Within the last 6-month period, he has conducted characterization of GmAPDs for small and large (overload) optical stimulus conditions.  This effort was in support of improving our APD models, and as input to AL1 ROIC design guidance.  Optical overload is a critical condition for the AL1 receiver, and Bill’s work here is important for increasing the damage threshold for our design.

Bill has also worked on the AL1 laser driver effort.  He was an instrumental part of the team that decided the laser drive architecture, including a specifying a custom chip development, (not selected), as well as researching the latest commercial offerings and techniques.  Working with prototyping staff, he developed and tested prototype drivers, yielding valuable insight toward the final laser driver design.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"LocalMap

Designed and implemented a short term implementation to serve the map to localization. Worked with Rob's team to figure out what was needed and delivered the code on time to meet localizations needs. This code has proven reliable over the 6 months it has been in production.

VectorMap on sqlite

Implemented the code to load the vector map from an SQLite database file (instead of a json file) and rolled out a transition to SQLIte databases that didn't break teams that are still using JSON maps.

VectorMap

Took over maintenance work on the VectorMap code and extended it to support new schema as needed.

LogExtractor and reading/writing directly to S3

Modified the log reader to read directly from S3 (at about 450 MBi/sec) and also modified the LogExtractor to write it's output directly to S3. Took ownership of the log extractor and dealt with a number of issues that came up with that code and enhanced it as needed to meet the needs of the map production pipeline.

TileLayerCache and VectorMapCache

Designed a replacement for the LocalMap to serve a single map stored on the vehicle to the tasks that need it. Worked mostly with Rob and some with the other teams to identify the requirements and come up with a design for a robust and maintainable implementation for serving the maps. Figured out how the configuration for the new system could be backward compatible to minimize disruption during the transition.

Other Stuff

Pitched in during code red to get back traces from exceptions thrown on the vehicle and to get the Expected class to work with error codes instead of exceptions.

Figured out why the CI analyzer output was garbage and why the thread analyzer was complaining about races in the logging code and fixed the catch library to make logging thread safe in our unit tests.",,,Bob Hyer,bhyer@argo.ai,Bob Hyer,bhyer@argo.ai,Software,

This is probably because Bob's code contributions ""just work"".  (It also might be because I am still in the early stages of learning C++).  In any case, I don't think I've heard complaints about the map _code_ being broken.  It's possible that those grumblings don't filter down to me, but I think that the reality is that Bob's code is solid -- which is a very good thing because he's currently the single-point-of-failure that is the mapping team's interface with the vehicle.

In addition, I've added a few minor features to the onboard code and it was a very straight-forward process -- even for someone who is still early on the C++ learning curve.  I think that speaks for Bob's code quality as well.",,,Matt Gilson,mgilson@argo.ai,Bob Hyer,bhyer@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"I worked with Bob on serving up tile data to tasks on the vehicle. He was able to get in a back end shared memory map server much quicker than I've seen that kind of work be done before. He brought a lot of experience to the task and jumped right to the most straight forward and efficient implementation which saved a lot of time. When splitting up the work I was confident he could take his piece and get it done correctly with a good eye toward design. His code is always simple, straight forward and readable. It was a great balance working with him to keep the overall design of the system clean and simple.

During code red he got back traces added to our exception code quickly.

The bug he found in catch was a really tricky one. It was also a really hard one to find. The creator of the library is a top notch C++ engineer so tracking down bugs in his code is no easy feat because the mistakes that are made are not straightforward.

During code red I remember going back and forth with him tracking down a bug on a Saturday in the calibration or stereo vision repo. His insight to the problem was great.

These both demonstrated very sophisticated understanding of C++, and strong debugging skills.
* Is able and willing to step into problem areas and help implement longer term fixes to reduce technical debt.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Born came into this company with a tall task ahead of him.  He was taking over an office basically in disarray, and also had to spend two weeks working closely with me.

Fortunately for everyone he's proven to be up to both of those unenviable tasks.  He was quickly able to restore order in Dearborn and didn't even try to lock me out of the office once (that I'm aware of).  I can't really overstate the chaotic situation he was walking into, but things in Dearborn are now running smoothly.  He quickly picked up on how we want things to be done in this company and has made sure to correct things that were not previously done properly while making sure he's following the proper procedures going forward.  He has also added valuable experience to our team.

He possesses what to me is an important mix of being capable and competent on his own, while also not being afraid to ask for help or advice when he thinks he might need it.  He and I have discussed many different issues, the most recent that comes to mind being some issues with Dave Schwanky's laptop.  Dave had problems with the OS on his laptop, Born took a shot at them but decided he needed a hand, so he reached out to me and I looked into the issue myself.  I was able to resolve the issue, but discussed with Dave the encryption situation and offered to get a new drive set up for him with encryption added.  I didn't have to think twice about whether Born would be willing or able to get this done.  Dave accepted my offer, Born and I worked together to get it done (this was his first time setting up a computer in this manner with us so I was guiding him), and we ultimately have a happy user.

He also goes above and beyond to help the team/company.  One major example of this was when we were having problems with getting the badge readers installed and he ended up just installing them himself.  Also he's stuck bouncing back and forth between Federal and Commerce, which can get pretty annoying, but you never hear him complain about it at all.

Born is also just generally a nice guy, and he's easy to talk to and get along with, which also makes him easy to work with.

This helped me remain focused on my work without becoming distracted by resource downtime.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"This cycle saw a shift to working on the larger core components of localization.  The two largest achievements were the upgrading of the map interface to support map caching and the creation of a deterministic localization resim tool.  These improve both the capabilities of the vehicle, and added new ways for us to analyze performance and improve our code base.

Deterministic Localization adds several capabilities to the localization system. Currently, changes to localization have to be strictly evaluated by hand, requiring many logs and ride alongs to completely understand it's impact.  While developing this tool, I worked closely with Kunal Desai to understand what information he wanted, not only now but also in the future so it could better integrate into his ADAF pipeline goals.  Taking it a step further, I worked with Kunal and the Job Platform team to integrate the tool as cloud resource.  Soon, changes to localization will be run through the tool in the cloud and compared to previous versions, giving us a powerful way to analyze changes in performance.

This tool also helps support the work of the mapping team.  In much the same way that new localization changes can be tested, new versions of a map can be tested as well.  This helps to provide a rigorous metric based analysis on how much better or worse a map is affecting performance.  In further support of this, several additional tools were created.  One creates global pose messages from log data, allowing a map's origin to change between versions but still maintain the logs ability to provide the necessary information to localize. Another allows for localizations output to be amended into an existing log.  This means that a log previously without map aligned pose could be amended to include it, allowing for a greater number of logs to be used for map updates.

For all of last year the vehicle was only able to operate on either a single large map or a single tile of the map.  This contributed to the limiting the vehicle's effective top speed because switching tiles would cause a delay in ICP's output. I worked with Jason Zigler to modify his LocalMapInterface so it would support the caching of future tiles.  This was able to lower ICP's downtime between map tiles and remove at least one road block to increasing the driving speed.  While initially delayed due to code red, it's roll out went off without a hitch and was quickly turned on permanently.

I also believe that I have grown as a software engineer this cycle, having worked on code that affects a greater number of teams.  For instance I was told by Dave Newman that my usage of boost UDP communications, as seen in the v0 Velodyne task, was being used as the basis for his UDPListener class.  This class is now used to interface with the PCAN, PITT, and Velodyne sensors.  I was able to find a subtle but far reaching bug in Task heartbeats.  And when I felt that feature flagged code wasn’t getting tested enough, I stepped up to expanded feature flags so our unit testing framework/CI could better support it.

As for improving my communication/collaboration skills, I have made a real effort to reach out and talk to the other teams here in Dearborn.  For instance, I often speak with Peter McHale on things like algorithms, C++ features, programming best practices, etc.  His manager told me that they appreciated my support. During the code red, I worked with others to coordinate efforts so that localization code was worked on by me.  This freed others to refocus on code that they were more familiar with.  And as growth from last cycle, I think I do a better job of reaching for help when I get stuck.  I have a better sense now of when to recognize that I'm struggling and need to talk to someone else to get help work through a problem.

The software engineer seminar series continued to provide a platform for showcasing best practices here at Argo, with a number of talks this cycle.  Topics including performance, proper error handling, c++ 17 features, and Docker usage.  A link to all the presentations can be found here:

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"## Deterministic Localization Resimulation Tool
Brendan led the design and development of a deterministic localization resimulation tool. This tool is a core component that will be used not only by the localization team to perform regression analysis as we further develop/enhance the localization system, but it will also be heavily used by the mapping team as part of their traffic light pipeline. This tool is critical for both teams to move faster without sacrificing quality or performance of their respective subsystems.

## Collaboration
I believe Brendan is one of the engineers at Argo that really stands out for his teamwork and collaboration. Brendan consistently lends a helping hand wherever he can, sharing his knowledge and understanding of best practices. He makes it very comfortable for others to work with him. I personally will often ask him technical questions and for his opinion on technical details because of his thoughtful responses.

Brendan has shown growth in several areas:
* His technical communication was excellent during the design review phase of the localization resim tool. His presentation was well thought-out and presented in an easily digestible manner. His strong understanding of the details showed by his concise and effective diagrams.
* His technical expertise in software architecture improved. He utilized new C++17 features such as std::variant effectively when designing the localization resim tool.
* His technical intuition has grown. He instinctively developed auxiliary tools for the localization resim tool that will be used and were needed. Furthermore, the tools are well designed and easily extensible.",,,Kunal Desai,kdesai@argo.ai,Brendan Byrne,bbyrne@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Brendan is a key member in localization team. He has delivered the map caching system and the deterministic localization resim tool, both projects are essential pieces for our online and offline localization systems. Brendan gained a lot of experience with the Jobs platform and he is the expert in localization team when for scalable offline tools. Brendan's coding skills are steadily improving, and that is well reflected in the sequence of his PRs. Brendan should keep up his great work and he is well on the trajectory to become a senior Engineer very soon. ",,,Ben Xinjilefu,xxx@argo.ai,Brendan Byrne,bbyrne@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Brendan is good at communicating and helpful.  The first week at Argo i was thrust into working on a problem that required multiple changes to multiple repositories.  Brendan was fortunately at Pitt that week.  He was instrumental in me getting up to speed on how to build the code and work with the multiple repositories.  I really appreciated his willingness to step in and help out.

I have had multiple times where i asked for his knowledge on specific parts of the localization stack and he was able to point me at the correct part of the code.  For example when doing bootstrapping i needed a way to find the ground surface of where the sample was.  I knew he had done something like this at some point so i asked him and he quickly pointed out where in the code there was a working example. 

He successfully landed caching support for tiles which had a big impact on runtime performance of the scanmatcher task.  

His design review for deterministic localization went well.  I believe he came up with an elegant solution to the problem of storing and playing back messages at the correct time delay. He had his design doc reviewed by the right people before the meeting with upper management and that allowed the meeting to go well.",,,Ben Ballard,bballard@argo.ai,Brendan Byrne,bbyrne@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"* Has demonstrated great collaboration capabilities in landing the map caching support in localization. Exemplified the principle of ""strong beliefs, loosely held"" in discussions about map caching support, clearly communicating technical decisions and reasoning leading to them, while remaining open to alternate viewpoints and working to arrive at both the best decision locally, while also refining best practices to spread to future work.
* Has worked well to develop features with relatively minimal supervision, with good awareness of when to reach out for guidance or clarification. Some of the more difficult uses of git to deal with long-standing PRs in the map caching code did not hold up work for long, as Brendan did a great job in trying to work through the issues himself, and asking for help before getting too bogged down in the issues. This demonstrated good intuition for sizing up problems and making tradeoffs for ensuring code lands, strong communication skills in providing clear, specific scoping of technical issues, and being able to scope required assistance to maximize contributions without overly relying on others.
* Feature flag testing demonstrated good insight and forward looking thinking to see an instance where advocating for improvements was able to shift discussion from maintaining the status quo to improving the ability to support tests around feature flags.",,,Jason Ziglar,jziglar@argo.ai,Brendan Byrne,bbyrne@argo.ai,Software,

I as put together my reader application, I realized that while I have a lot of good submitted PRs, I am lacking in the number of reviewed PRs.  I have to start making a more proactive effort to track down PR's that I can comment on.

I think my design document and presentation skills could use improvement.  Things like creating a comprehensive test plan and estimating what additional tools will be needed were lacking during my last design review.

I think that could be better at understanding all of the debug information coming from the pose filter.  If I want to be better at knowing why our system is at times failing, then I need to have a better idea what all the debug signals coming off the car actually mean.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"For the past six months I have been tasked with organizing, directing, and contributing to photodiode array (PDA) development. I believe the pragmatic approach I have taken towards decision making has been effective in developing a detector that satisfies LiDAR OKRs, and my ability to consistently advance design progress among competing opinions and difficult vendor relationships speaks well to my value as a team member. My individual contributions have been critical to advancing the state of the design, and my communications with coworkers outside my immediate team have been dependably clear and effective.

While my increasing leadership responsibilities help demonstrate my professional growth over this period, I believe I have also shown substantial growth in my abilities as a mediator: finding common ground, steering from extraneous arguments, and keeping the team focused achieving the task at hand. I have done this primarily through my daily maintenance of the detector design minutes document, clearly enumerating daily agendas, notes, and tasks.

A summary list of my accomplishments from the past six months is below, followed by further discussion:

• Issued US Patent 9,935,138 B2 in April, following application revision in November

• Managed daily PDA design meetings
	- Oversaw tapeout of first-generation 1D PDA
	- Oversaw development of 1D PDA “Short Loop” DoE
	- Oversaw tapeout of 2D resistor PDA design, ensuring PDAs will arrive in time to test overstress mitigation prior to Gen 2 1D PDA tapeout
	- Wrote ""post-mortem"" of 2D PDA design process summarizing schedule, highlighting design and communication shortfalls, recommending changes; organized meeting with team for discussion and feedback
	- Maintained PDA design program schedule
	- Performed regular device, process, and mask design work on all PDA variants
	- Created new “Wafer Growth Specification” documents formalizing epitaxial growth communications; led communications with epitaxial growth vendor (VPEC) during specification development

• Directed MLA development effort
	- Oversaw tapeout of 1D MLAs
	- Defined specifications, communicated needs with vendor, directed vendor optical design efforts in conjunction with simultaneous PDA design efforts
	- Evaluated and approved optical design reports as PDA optical interface lead

• Completed first iteration of Argo LiDAR PDA non-sequential optical crosstalk simulation; deeper dive into study to begin shortly

• Worked with various LiDAR leads in defining key PDA and MLA budgets, interface specifications, schedule requirements, and performance metrics

• Led weekly calls with PDA processing vendor for past month; efficacy and tone of one-on-one communications with vendor (GCS) have improved noticeably since

• Interviewed nine candidates for Argo LiDAR team 

• Served as Principal Investigator for SBIR AF171-118 and submitted interim report to Air Force in final days of PLI operation, closed out program following Argo acquisition

• Aided Goodwill valuation effort of PLI through organization of existing intellectual property following Argo acquisition

With regard to the achievements outlined above, I have reliably delivered results on time. In the case of PDA meetings, I have come prepared for every meeting with a clear agenda laid out since their inception in November, never started late, held meetings when the office was closed for inclement weather, and consistently followed up with team members on action items when progress has fallen behind. I regularly turn around internal and external inquiries promptly without regard to time received, and both the clarity and concision of my communications have improved as my responsibilities have grown.

As I have interacted more with employees outside of my immediate group, I have gained an interest in participating more in the wider LiDAR system discussion. It is my hope that my demonstration of consistent growth when trusted with additional responsibility will serve as a catalyst for this.",,,Brian Piccione,bpiccione@argo.ai,Brian Piccione,bpiccione@argo.ai,Hardware,

•	Major technical contribution  during this period of time is to implement the device design into mask layouts. Some of the designs are hard to communicate to GCS in word format, such as certain resistor types in 128x32 arrays and metal trace/bonding pad configurations in 512x2 arrays. Brian has been spending a great deal of effort to draw these features and communicate with GCS, and these efforts are very important  for the successful completion of mask layouts.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"With the LiDAR system development still in an early stage, and many moving parts at play, it can be difficult to pin down exactly which components presently lie in the critical schedule path. ROIC delivery was easily identified up front as the most obvious hindrance to achieving our year-end goals, but 1D PDA delivery was perceived more as a second-tier concern. As PDA deadlines have slipped and the second iteration PDA delivery date has followed suit, it has become clear to me that PDA progress was not moved as quickly as it could have been. I believe I share responsibility for this.

In the PDA development process, there are many stakeholders to buy into a given design prior to tapeout. Initial designs must be reviewed by a panel with all interfacing teams (e.g. packaging, testing, transmitter, LiDAR system), and these are iterated, and presented before the same stakeholders until an initial consensus is formed. From there, the design team iterates on execution ideas, eventually communicating with external vendors to obtain their buy-in. Further design iterations must occur in concert with vendors, and prior to finalization the original stakeholders must be brought in again to sign off. There are numerous opportunities for diversion, distraction, and detour along the way.

References above to my pragmatism in guiding PDA meetings were in reference to keeping the team on track through this process. Of course, there are times when discussion must open up and the conversation is allowed to roam, and this is a judgment call I'm still learning to balance. Given the inherent complexity of the process, the length of time from conception to tapeout can only be compressed so much: maybe a few days could have been shaved off, maybe over a week.

Still, there are a number of potential root causes here that we need to evaluate as a team: perhaps our strained communications with our PDA vendor were a factor, perhaps our core design methodology needs examination, or maybe our schedules was simply not fleshed out well enough to understand we were approaching LiDAR ""progress rate-limiting"" territory. I don't know the answer to this yet. However, just as I completed a ""post-mortem"" upon completion of the 2D PDA design process, I will be writing a post-mortem for this first iteration of the 1D PDA: program schedule will be re-examined, key roadblocks will be identified, and suggestions will be made for the second iteration of the design.",,,Brian Piccione,bpiccione@argo.ai,Brian Piccione,bpiccione@argo.ai,Hardware,

There are many obstacles in the path of developing the detector. Schedules slip and we, the team, all share responsibility for this.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"I joined Argo on Dec 18, 2017 as a Software Engineer II in the Visualization Tools team. Since then, I have worked on and owned various problems and subsystems, including:
1.	Annotation hashtag autocompletion (https://github.com/argoai/av/pull/1288)
2.	Annotation visualization plugin (https://github.com/argoai/av/pull/2330)
3.	Diagnostics visualization with graph (https://github.com/argoai/av/pull/3860)
4.	Diagnostics based basic system health plugin (https://github.com/argoai/av/pull/3871)
5.	Situational awareness display, including improving VectorMap drawing (https://github.com/argoai/av/pull/4490), improving ConvexHull track drawing (https://github.com/argoai/av/pull/5088)., etc.
6.	Numerous small features and fixes to the Viz tool and other subsystems.

Functionally, I have made the following contributions to the company.
1.	Provided support for internal UI/Viz tools (e.g., Argonaut) with quick turnaround. I have created features and plugins to the system that have greatly improved my clients’ efficiency. For example, autocompletion for hashtags in annotation enables vehicle operators to input annotations more quickly and consistently. Diagnostics visualization plugin was created during “code red” that serves as the front end of the diagnostics system to support virtually all teams for system diagnostics. The plugin was delivered in time and has received positive feedback from VOs. Diagnostics-based basic system health plugin will replace the existing comms-based basic system health system, which is hard to customize to meet VOs’ increasing needs. The system adds a new ability to Diagnostics to enable sending signal validity information and allow users to freely configure interested signals. 
2.	Own situational awareness display that will support external users. To support the upcoming Miami Experience event, I have started working on creating a polished and customized view of the system for vehicle passengers. This task requires not only more technical polishing of the existing Viz tool but also substantial work on improving the design and UX of the system. So far, I have improved VectorMap drawing that is more life-like and stabilized bouncy tracks. I will continue this work to maximumly show the capability of our technology and assure user confidence.

Technically, I have quickly caught up with the speed of a startup and transformed myself from a former researcher role into a professional software engineer. I have gained sufficient knowledge in areas that I was not familiar with, such as advanced features of git, modern C++, OpenGL, docker, etc., and I am always proficient in my skilled areas, such as Qt, UI/UX design and engineering, and system design. 

I have always followed software engineering best practices and coding standards and delivered quality code in time. For example, I have refactored two plugins (DiagnosticsVisualizationPlugin and DiagnosticsBasedBasicSystemHealthPlugin) in order to remove redundant code. I have refactored VectorMapPlugin applying Design Patterns such as “Strategy” and “Template Method” to enable two versions of drawing to co-exist while reusing as much code as possible. I have extracted code related to smoothing in ConvexHullPlugin using the “Bridge” and “Strategy” Design Patterns to ease future improvements in smoothing tracks. I have written unit tests and test tools for DiagnosticsValiditySignalData and DiagnosticsReader, as they are infrastructure code that has a larger impact. Similarly, I updated DisplayPrimitivesTestTask for newly added DisplayPrimitives drawing functions.

Organizationally, I have become an expert in the subsystems that I have created or worked on and am a go-to person for the Viz tool for many people. I have constantly work with other teams for problems across multiple teams. For example, I have worked with: core team to add an ability to the Diagnostics system to enable sending validity signals; tracking team to improve ConvexHull drawing and pedestrian drawing; motion planning to improve VectorMap drawing; Vehicle Operation team for improving and redesigning Argonaut. I have also provided suggestions to the Triage team for running the Viz tool on the cloud.

To summarize, I believe I consistently meet all the requirements of Software Engineer II and exceed the expectations in some of the areas, such as system design and ownership. More specifically, I have taken the leadership of solving problems across teams and proactively improved complex system design that will benefit long-term health of the system. 

I feel lucky to have found a wonderful career in Argo that fully utilizes my skills, perfectly matches my interests, and provides unlimited growing opportunities. In 2018, I am assigned to more independent responsibilities such as owning the situational awareness display that will have huge impact on public’s experience with Argo. I look forward to learning more from my job and contribute more to the company, and I will continuously work towards the next ladder in my career.",,,Carl Chen,cchen@argo.ai,Carl Chen,cchen@argo.ai,Software,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Carl started with making improvement to Basic System Health plugin. Some of the major contributions are:
 - Annotation hash tag completion which is very useful for vehicle operators
 - Annotation visualization
 - Diagnostics based health system plugin and visualization with graph which are very appreciated by both operators and engineers.
 - Other improvements and bug fixes to visualization tools.

Recently, he has grown to own all areas of work related to Situational Awareness.

He is very easy to work with! Since we work very closely and need to touch what Carl developed in almost daily basis, I can appreciate the care he take to develop software. His design and code quality is always been very very good.",,,Saravanan Poosanthiram,spoosanthiram@argo.ai,Carl Chen,cchen@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Carl has consistently delivered important functionalities to the Visualization Tools which have high impact to customers even with the short amount of time since he joined Argo. Some of the examples include annotation auto complete, diagnostics visualization plugins, and improvement to VectorMap rendering.

Carl accomplished these deliverable with well written design document that is clear and easy to understand, following Argo's guide line for code development, and having proper testing.

Carl also made himself available and was willing to help me when I asked. For example, when I need an extra set of eyes from the visualization team to review my code.",,,TinTin Yu,tyu@argo.ai,Carl Chen,cchen@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"I helped on adding few features for track convex hull drawing last year. And Carl took the owner ship and has been constantly improving the results, as well as adding new features since he joined last year. For example, Carl added feature to replace convex hull with circle when object is pedestrian, by investigating object's geometric features. It has been working really well given the fact we do not have semantic information in the tracks. Carl has also greatly improved the quality and stability of the track bounding cuboid (a feature derived from convex hull) by utilizing temporal filtering. Carl is also the go-to person for visualization in Mountain View office. He has provided great support on any question regarding visualization so far. Overall, I find working with Carl is enjoyable and I am looking forward to having more cool/helpful features delivered by Carl.",,,Yi Zhang,yzhang@argo.ai,Carl Chen,cchen@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Carl has been a solid contributor since joining the Visualization (Viz) team.  He quickly came up to speed on the software development tools Argo uses and was able to begin contributing early.  As an example:  Carl was only at Argo a short time prior to code red, but he jumped and was able to deliver the diagnostic visualization plugin to help all of the teams visualize the errors within the system.
Carl has also been able to juggle multiple different threads of work and jump between them based on priority.  For example, the beginning of Q2 Carl was tasked with owning the viz improvements for the Situational Awareness (SA) display.  However, about a month into the quarter a plugin for mapping QA was prioritized.  Carl was able to switch gears and jump in to deliver on that task with little to no buffer.  
Carl is also a well known and trusted member of the Viz team externally.  He is active on slack giving quick responses to questions and diving into issues with outside teams as needed.  ",,,Mike Lambert,mlambert@argo.ai,Carl Chen,cchen@argo.ai,Software,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Chao spearheaded the efforts to analyze the Princeton Lightwave GCD lidar system prototype point cloud data provided to Argo during the acquisition technical due diligence phase.  He wrote programs to analyze and visualize the data, and developed a comprehensive slide deck that outlined system performance and various artifacts observed in the data sets.  In these tasks, he made rapid progress, and was consistently engaged to learn more about the inner workings of the lidar system and phenomenology of the data artifacts.  We also spoke about ideas regarding lidar simulation tools, but unfortunately we never followed up on these ideas.  

Chao is an excellent communicator, an attentive listener, very thoughtful, and very easy to talk to about any matters.  He was a pleasure to work with, and a great addition to the Argo team.  I think very highly of him, but am only giving him a score of 2 because I did not work with him long enough to know certainly that he is 'likely ready for promotion' as is defined by the Argo performance review scoring convention.

To my knowledge he has been the main, if not the only, Argo representative on Security when interfacing with the entire Ford team. To my knowledge he has been one of the key Argo representatives on embedded computation requirements facing suppliers and will also play a key role in making compute-related hardware tradeoffs.

1.  Better idea of mass production scalabilities for hardware system integration and large supply chain management consideration in system design.  My past work experience in mass production is not on the same scale.  I am definitely gaining an appreciation for the scale of the problem.

Projects that could have gone better:
1. Compute resource requirement estimation is a project where I think I could have done a better job, even if there's a high volatility in system design, reasonable constraints can be made.  However, with the approaching Z2 design freeze, the variables are fluctuating less, but not quite settled yet.  
2.  HARA development is another area where I could have done better if I had a deeper understanding of the software architecture before hand.  I think the order of operation here would have made a significant improvement.

Because you have such great depth of knowledge and expertise in so many areas, you know all the details. Unfortunately, sometimes your audience may not. 

For me a good example of this is the AVS compute HW trade study. It was well done and included lots of great info, but was hard for me to know the high level pros and cons of each CPU choice. Note I may just not be looking at the right doc:) 

",,,Ryan Skaff,rskaff@argo.ai,Ching Hu,chu@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Ching and I seem to approach problems differently. While I tend to ruminate on how to set a problem up correctly before diving in, I notice Ching tends to dive in right away. Our two approaches each has its pros and cons; from my vantage point sometimes I wonder if Ching may dive in too deep too quickly. 

The functional safety concept for Motion Planning is an example. He went into the documentation and pulled together the entire SW block diagram, then created a functional safety concept for Motion Planning as a whole. This is all really good work! But perhaps along the way, he could have asked whether in the fast pace of Argo SW development, how much of his starting assumptions were truly up to date; whether he wanted to step back and evaluate how much of his efforts were for the current implementation of the SW as opposed to the intended future implementation of the SW; whether his FSRs would be resilient to changes in implementation; whether he wanted to start the collaboration with Motion Planning earlier in case they took his FSRs as imposed requirements rather than requirements everyone would easily agree to.

Put another way, in terms of being able to zoom-in and zoom-out of a system at will, I find Ching is more zoomed-in, while I tend to be the opposite. Again both of our approaches have their pros and cons and I am not saying that I don't need improvement myself. I would, however, recommend to Ching that with his great ability to zoom-in, if he also masters zooming-out, he'd be even better than he is today.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"**Autonomy Integration**
Team Lead - I lead the Autonomy Integration team for my first couple months at Argo. 

_Q4 Miles OKR_ - I helped marshal feature integration, vehicle allocation and day-to-day integration priority to help achieve the Q4 autonomous miles OKR. I facilitated daily meetings and communicated high level Autonomy Integration results across Argo. 

_Fleet Priority and Allocation_ - I worked with Ops to define the fleet allocation for the end of Q4 and Q1. This was based on planned developer needs and vehicle operator staffing in Pittsburgh and Dearborn. This included allocation for New Stanton ramp up which was not finalized at the time.

**STS**
_STS Team Lead_ - I guided STS team through initial formation and ramp up, expanding the role of a strong Performance Analysis team for increased development impact. I guided creation of the team workflow, goals and near term vision which are still in use. I was primary author of the feature/scenario framework for organizing scenarios and results. This bridges the gap between development and system engineering. It involves a common approach for integration of all system testing modalities: simulation, track and fleet testing.

_Sim Scenario creation_ - I lead the STS team in producing scenarios from 1) required system features, 2) developer needs, and 3) problem cases from track and road testing. I helped create the workflow for scenario/metric maturity, lifecycle and promotion/demotion to ensure that scenarios used in org level test sets are stable, sound and provide meaningful results.

_Sim triage_ - I lead the STS team in taking responsibility for Sim Triage, previously handled by the SimEng team. This is the basis for regression testing and feedback to Prediction, MP and MC developers. It also provides org visibility into AV performance as well as the performance of the simulation engine and offline jobs platform.

_Scenario creation, management and analysis tools_ - I lead the STS team formulating initial scenario creation, management and analysis tools. In the long term, these will be critical to evaluating overall Argo progress toward launch.

**System Feature and Scenarios Approach (Miami to Job 1)**
_Miami Experience Operating Area_ - With the help Ops and SysEng, I gathered info related to region scouting. I played a key role in assessing a variety of scouting data and pushing for a better operating area for Miami Experience.  The recommendation was communicated to and accepted by Ford and is now the basis for Fleet Ops in Miami.

_Feature and Scenario Based Assessment_ - I presented scouting data to SW leads and worked with developers on a manageable list of system level autonomy features for the Miami Experience and beyond to Job 1. I developed the general feature and scenario based assessment framework to support system level testing and evaluation. This was presented to Ford and the Board of Directors, and accepted as a candidate replacement of “autonomous miles” as a key metric to measure Argo progress for investment.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Chip led the Autonomy Integration team during a tumultuous and transformational time, as the software, operational, and triage components of Argo began solidifying their process as we began fleet operations. His breadth & depth of experience proved invaluable in this regard, as he had to interact across all levels of the organization, from entry-level Vehicle Operators to engineers to mid-to-senior leadership, and often with the executive team. Serving in this role was truly a _catch-22_, yet Chip served with dignity, grace, and enough _push_ to surprise many by helping Argo achieve our 4Q2017 mileage OKR!

Midway through 4Q2017, most of the team thought the 4Q mileage goals was unachievable. Yet, Chip arrived and restructured the Autonomy Integration team, organized daily integration meetings, improved daily triage/integration notes, and improved integration planning (vs non-stop firefighting).  He nudged Argo towards a better balance between agility and process/structure, by ensuring a general structure exists, but allowing deviations. These efforts, along with Chip's leadership style played a critical role in achieving this OKR.

Chip is a proven leader across a wide-range of stakeholders and projects at Argo. In addition to his technical and organizational competence, he is a hard-working, caring, and well-rounded manager/co-worker.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"In my short time here I've been consistently impressed by your depth of knowledge and experience in the AV field.  You clearly have a solid vision of how to break down and describe the challenge facing us into digestable work and describe it to others as demonstrated through your work with both the Miami and J1 features.  You also have a talent for organizing and automating access to this data, your spreadsheets are amazing.

I've been very impressed with how you manage the team.  There's clearly differing opinions on the direction people want to go, but you've very calmly and firmly ensured that folks stay on track.  You keep the team focused on the important goals and set aside the less important ones for later.  I think the work developing scenarios is a great example of this, focusing on producing Scenarios to have a base to work with quickly rather than automating and delaying producing product for teams to work with.  Then when resources were tight and we started needing to focus on supporting customers through triage you rightly reduced the focus on scenario numbers.

Your work on the Miami experience was exceptional.  The attention to detail in the area selection your annotation of the videos and your knowledge of the route is clearly evident.  You're knowledge of the state of the vehicle what we can achieve with it resulted in an excellent route that I think is reasonable and achievable.  It's just the right amount of push for the team.

It's clear that you are the goto guy for important projects and you always deliver.  Miami Experience, J1 Features all are very high visibility projects and all were handled well and delivered what was needed to management.  You kept a handle on them and used your resources under tight time pressure to deliver high quality information.",,,John Seminatore,jseminatore@argo.ai,Chip DiBerardino,cdiberardino@argo.ai,Software,

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"I need to work more actively with the STS team on fleshing out the _long term technical vision_ for the team and communicate it within the team and externally to the org. To date, the priority and focus has been on immediate output, e.g. of scenario creation. Longer term needs such as tools and roadmap have been back burnered. I need to put more focus on the longer term view moving forward and communicating that broadly.

I have not done a very good job at _tracking system and implementation details across our system_. My focus has been more at a black-box level, i.e. outside view but agnostic to internals. The “what” not the “how”. This impacted my performance at Autonomy Integration lead. The details matter. Architecture and design details have a significant impact at the system level. I need to more consistently dig into and track the component designs to support system engineering.

I should take more ownership of gray areas or unfilled gaps in our development, tools or system. Simply highlighting gaps is not always adequate. I need to be more proactive in _driving areas outside of my primary responsibility_, if nobody else is filling the gap.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,report,"One area I think STS can improve on is better identifying priorities especially from other teams and from upper management.  Chip has also mentioned this which was encouraging.  There have been multiple times where we have gone into fire drill modes and have had all or almost all of the team members working on a new task.  In some cases like the recent feature enumeration, this seems appropriate although in other cases it was not as clear.  One recommendation for Chip is that as requests come in from upper management or other teams, we should communicate with them the impact on existing planned work to better gauge when large disruptions to near term tasking are warranted and when new tasks can be moved to later sprints with less disruptions.  

Most of the time, working with Chip is enjoyable.  One area that I've observed is that when I've disagreed with him on a few occasions, he has a tendency to lean towards authoritarian responses.  In one instance, I pointed out concern that our feature generation was subjective and somewhat arbitrary with respect to variations in scenario numbers across features and I was worried that we had to ensure we kept a tight enough loop with feedback from actual testing and experiences on the road.  During the initial discussion, he was very adamant that it wasn't.  On another occasion, I proposed that we could move up prioritization of setting up scenarios from logs and then utilize SimOps to label these scenarios as a way to reduce the risk of not getting the number of scenarios we want to get done finished.  Chip strongly objected and ended discussion on the topic in the meeting.  In both cases, over time when I figured out Chip's rational, it was usually reasonable and I found he had other methods to address my concerns, but he could be more open to discussing other opinions, identifying the source of disagreements and communicating his reasoning.  This has been the most frustrating part as a senior member of the STS team.  In my most recent role prior to Argo, the manager I reported to had a reputation for being no-nonsense and demanding.  Working with her though, I had developed a good relationship where I felt comfortable bringing her new ideas.  If they weren't inline with what she was thinking, we'd try to identify where we disagreed and sometimes I changed her mind and sometimes she changed mine.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"I believe I have performing at the level of Senior Engineer during this review period. This extends to most of the previous period as well. For example, for the previous review period, Neal Seegmiller noted that he did not see a difference in productivity between me and the other senior engineers on the team, recommending me for promotion.

I have led the design and testing of several different features/components (see notable contributions). After helping to diagnose and triage many different events, I have become one of the go-to points of contact for people on other teams (particularly Motion Control, Prediction, and Tracking), when looking for help debugging on-vehicle issue or for interfacing related to motion planning. My work has had a significant impact on both team and company-wide goals, enabling us to meet both OKR and demo deadlines.

**Notable contributions (6 months 11/2017 - 5/2018):**

_Traffic Signal Behavior_
I designed, implemented, and tested Motion Planning’s traffic signal behavior. This included significant interfacing with the Detection team, particularly Reza. I was very thorough in both unit and simulation testing for this implementation, so that it worked on vehicle on the first attempt. Only a few integration-level issues involving timing, latency, and certain vehicles under-performing on braking had to be addressed afterwards.

_Predictions_
I designed and implemented the first version of predictions. This first involved a thorough design of the data structures including a design review with other L5 and L6 engineers. These data structures are now widely used in the code. After the data structures were implemented, I quickly implemented a preliminary version of prediction in order to enable yielding for other actors at intersections. This two-week implementation persisted for several months enabling preliminary intersection logic and helping us to meet our Q4 OKRs.

Since the prediction team has been formed, I am no longer directly writing prediction code. During the transition, I contributed to improving the static vs dynamic classification of movers. I have also helped to get several of the prediction team members (most notably Peter and Andrew) up to speed with the code, simulation, and the PR process. As prediction PRs still need a code-owner review from motion planning, until about two weeks ago, I was still reviewing almost every prediction PR. Outside of the team leads (Tom/Al), I have been the go-to person on the motion planning team for interfacing with prediction. One example of this is when Tom asked me to make the powerpoint presentation outlining motion planning’s Q2 needs from prediction.

_Trajectory Scoring_
I designed and implemented the code that scores trajectories and selects the trajectory with the lowest cost as the trajectory to act upon. I have also implemented most of the features that are used in the scoring. As a result, I am the engineer who is most familiar why a particular trajectory was selected and am often the called upon for debugging on-vehicle issues related to decision making.

_Lane Changes_
I was heavily involved in the push to develop lane change capability before the 3/29 demo. To begin with, I contributed heavily to the overall lane change design. This including writing the first high-level design document and helping to organize our thoughts from a four hour design meeting into an actionable plan.

During the beginning of the push for lane changes, I worked on improvements to the routing task in order to enable lane changes. First I implemented the RouteTracker to track progress along a route based on Neal’s design. Then, I adapted the routing task to produce routes containing multiple corridors so that downstream tasks to find lane change intervals. Next I designed and implemented the LaneChangeModule. This is the module in TrajectoryGenerator that selects where to lane change and what the constraints for the lane change reference path are going to be. I also implemented the scoring functions that are used to determine when it is safe to make a lane change. 

Getting the lane change code to work involved extensive testing in coordination with other members of the Motion planning team as well as the vehicle operations and autonomy integration teams. With this first version we were able to perform lane changes for the 3/29 demo.

_Intersections_
The other improvement I made in the rush for the 3/29 demo was making our vehicle behavior more naturally in intersections. This was done by adapting the scoring code from lane changes to work for intersections. Since this code was designed with both in mind, minimal changes were necessary. 

The largest portion of the work for intersections was testing and integration with new prediction code.  I spent the entire weekend before the demo dev testing with Dale and Brandon followed by offline debugging to determine why my intersection improvements were causing problems with lane changes. By adding more debugging and visualization, I was able to track down the two bugs that were actually in new prediction code. With the prediction fixes, we were able to complete lane changes and more natural intersections for the demo.

_Mover Decision Module_
In the past few weeks, I have been leading the design and implementation of the MoverDecisionModule, which will be used to classify moving obstacles as things were should either queue behind, veer around, or ignore. This included preparing for and leading a design review with Pete and Brett.

**Addressing other AI Issues and Code Red**
I have also spent a lot of time addressing AI issues. Some of the specific issues I have addressed include:

* Latching static obstacles to prevent steering into large trucks with the track disappears or switches to a dynamic classification. This provides an extra safety measure when tracking/prediction fail and has prevented several PCEs that used to frequently occur in Dearborn.
* Adding the first version of nearness to road boundary as an additional feature to improve static vs. dynamic classification of movers which was a major blocking issue around code red.
* Working with Scott/Alice to fix the “taking corners at Moon too fast” issue that crept up during code red. Despite my unfamiliarity with this portion of the code (it was primarily an MC issue), I volunteered to debug this during the code red push.
* I often triage AI issues that I see either on the autonomy-integration or fleet-ops-daily channels. I am also often asked by team members to help identify the cause of an observed issue.
* During code red, I organized Ed, Neal, and I in triaging all logs from a specific day, determining the reason behind each kickout, and logging it in a spreadsheet that I emailed out to the leadership. This effort was praised by both Bryan and Brett. This led to the identification that many of the kickouts were timeout related.
* I co-piloted the AV late into the night the day before the 3/29 demo with Al, Tom, and Brandon, which enabled us to identify that the rain was the source of tracking issues we had been seeing on-vehicle.
* I wrote a config validation method to more easily write validation for config values during code red. We use this function now in almost every class to ensure that our configurations are valid.

**Coding**
My code has gotten a lot cleaner than it was after I had just joined from academia. This is in large part due to of the great code reviews I believe we perform on the motion planning team. I have gotten better at scoping my PRs so that they are easier to review. Most of my PRs do not require significant revisions. I believe that I have also gotten better at reviewing PRs as well. I try to review more for content now rather than just a few nit-picky formatting issues as I did for the first couple of months after I joined Argo. I also try to review a lot of PRs and have probably been one of the most prolific reviewers on the team during the past six months. After writing and reviewing so much code, I was made both a reader and a code-owner for the motion planning repo.

**Leadership and Teamwork**
One of the reasons that my PRs require fewer revisions is the improvements I (and the motion planning team as a whole) have made in writing thorough design documents before implementation. I have written design documents for several different components in the system (see notable achievements above). I solicit feedback and respond. I am often willing to change my design if someone points out a fault or a better way to approach the problem (e.g. using a simpler approach for lane change abort constraints that Neal proposed in a recent design doc). I have performed similar reviews on many design documents that others have written.

I have grown as an individual contributor but have also improved in communicating with others on the team. I have helped to mentor several different team members, getting people familiar with the codebase and coding practices (both in Motion Planning and Prediction). A few examples of this are: (1) teaching new members of the Prediction team (Peter and Andrew) how to use simulation and helping review their cod, (2) helping Jay during several on-vehicle tests at new stanton until he got familiar enough with how to run the software that he could run it on his own, and (3) helping to on-board new engineers by being the “welcome buddy” for every new MP-MC-Sim new hire (5 total) in Pittsburgh since late October (except Ed, who was technically hired as A&I).

I believe I am seen by many on the team as having solid engineering judgement. I am often specifically asked (along with other L5 engineers on the team) to review design documents relating to motion planning. For example, Scott and Alice often ask my opinion on motion control issues that directly affect motion planning. My judgement is also taken seriously when I am worried about a potential problem. In a very recent example, I convinced Tom that, despite pressure from upper management, we should not yet enable lane change abort splines because additional work on the ACC code was required to make the maneuver safer.

I believe that the case above shows sustained performance at the Senior Engineer level. I have shown consistent leadership, results, and impact beyond the Software Engineer II level.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Chris did a great job summarizing his accomplishments over the last 6 months, so I have little to add. There is no embellishment in his account; he made major contributions in Traffic Signals, Predictions, Scoring, Lane Changes, and the Mover Decision Module just as he described.

Chris stands out on the team in a few key ways:
He takes initiative in designing new features. He is quick to put a design doc together. He comes prepared for team design meetings. He solicits feedback and he’s always receptive when I have concerns or alternative ideas. Chris advocates for learning-based approaches that we know will be necessary long term. His designs for Trajectory Scoring and Mover Decision Module support a near-term rules-based solution, but are extensible to a learning-based solution in the long term. 

He tests his code thoroughly on vehicle. He travels to New Stanton often. He is probably the most proficient on the team at collecting and troubleshooting logs.

He works very hard. He puts in extra hours on a consistent basis. In particular he pushed very hard to prepare for the 3/29 demo. He worked nights and weekends to thoroughly test and iterate on lane change code.

Chris doesn’t have as many years of industry experience as some senior engineers on the motion planning team, but from the quality and quantity of his work you wouldn’t know it. He has absolutely performed like a senior engineer in the last 6 months, and honestly even before that.",,,Neal Seegmiller,nseegmiller@argo.ai,Chris Cunningham,ccunningham@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Chris has made several significant contributions to the MP codebase. He designed and implemented major components, the most significant being the prediction libraries, scoring, lane changes, and the mover decision module.  They were well thought out and designed so that they could persist and evolve as the MP stack grows and changes. 

For the 3/29 demo the feature that had the most exposure was lane changing, which he took ownership of for the design, scope, development phases, implementation, and testing.  He worked many late hours for several weeks up until the demo to ensure that it was successful. I believe that the step improvement Ford observed in the capability of the Argo system was largely rooted in a successful lane change feature. 

Chris is responsive to issues that show up in Slack, and works with several different teams in addressing issues they encounter but also working with them to address issues Chris encounters. I often find that he is responding to issues raised by VehOps, Autonomy Integration, and Motion Controls.

His code quality has improved since he first joined and has taken much of the feedback he has gotten from other reviewers and now in his PRs there are minimal changes requested. He has taken the lead of the development of several major components and is taking the steps to planning out work tasks that will lead to the completion of those features. He performs in the capacity of a senior software engineer in designing, leading, and overseeing efforts. 

I recommend him for a promotion to a senior software engineer.",,,Ramadev Hukkeri,rhukkeri@argo.ai,Chris Cunningham,ccunningham@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Chris is an incredibly diligent worker. He puts in more hours than almost anyone else on the motion planning team, and his dedication to the project shows in his output. Last quarter, he led the effort to add lane changing to the motion planning stack. Due mostly to his efforts developing and testing the new feature, we were able to land it quickly and demonstrate it to stakeholders from Ford.

Chris, more than anyone else in the Pittsburgh office, works with new hires to bring them up to speed on the motion planning software stack and our coding practices. He has also been very helpful in spinning up the budding prediction team.

Chris values planning and organization. He uses design documents to effectively plan out new features before implementing them, which helps us review his ideas and saves a lot of time in the implementation phase.

On more than one occasion, Chris has taken the lead in triaging issues from testing. His organization and leadership helped us very quickly triage a large number of incidents down to a small handful of bugs. Our counterparts in autonomy integration recognize him as a point-of-contact for motion planning, and he is effective at troubleshooting issues discovered in the field.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"**Projects I could have done better on**

One of the projects that I could have done better was the implementation of the PredictionInterface. The data structures were well thought out but the implementation of the algorithms to populate the data structures was rushed and not well planned beforehand. This was in large part due to push for this functionality before the end of a quarter to hit an OKR. This lack of initial design was later made worse as more features were added to the class to address high-priority AI issues that cropped up. The planned design for “V1” of the PredictionInterface was continually pushed off as low-priority. The result was a difficult-to-maintain class that is currently being refactored. 

To help prevent this, I should have pushed back on the scheduling push by at least a few days in order to better architect the initial design. I should have also made time for refactoring earlier in the process. Part of this was also due to spinning up a new prediction team and some uncertainty of who was responsible for the existing prediction code. Better communication and clarity would have certainly helped.

Another project where I could have done better was the route expansion code. Going into it, I had believed it to be much simpler than it turned out to be. The function to expand corridors ended up very complicated and fairly hard to follow. However, if I had spent more time doing this design beforehand and realized the difficulties, I could have realized that some changes to datastructures would have made this easier. Instead, we are now making those datastructure changes, which is harder to do after the fact. I need to make sure to set aside time for thorough design before implementation in order to reduce later refactoring time.

**General areas needing improvement**
While I have gotten better at coding and PR reviews, I still have plenty of room for improvement. In terms of PR reviews, I need to make sure that I spend enough time on each review to fully understand the code, which can be difficult when there is a lot going on. In terms of c++ coding, I need to make sure that I design with extensibility in mind. There are a few times that I’ve had to change more code than necessary because of lack of foresight when originally writing it. For example, I was asked to reduce the buffer for collision checking during lane changes as the AV moves through the transition. When attempting to do so, I realized that I had not written the code in a way for it to be straightforward to do that.

I also have room for improvement in communication and documentation. In particular, I need to get better at issue reporting. There have been a couple times when I’ve noticed an unrelated issue while testing my code and did not file a ticket for the bug because I was too focused on the task at hand  (e.g. TrajectoryGenerator task crashing while driving in manual). While I am a strong communicator within motion planning and closely related teams (i.e. motion control, prediction), I could still improve in communicating with other teams across the organization.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Chris has no major shortcomings to address. My advice would be to keep doing what he’s doing. 

When he started, his software engineering skills had room for improvement; but the same is true for myself and most of us in motion planning. I recommend that Chris continue to improve his software engineering skills and learn best practices. As time allows, thoroughly review the PRs of other team members to help them improve. When designing new features, consider how you can split up and delegate the implementation to other team members.

In addition to designing new features, consider how existing ones can be simplified and made more robust. The motion planning stack has become very complex, such that it’s increasingly difficult to troubleshoot and maintain. Brainstorm and advocate for simple, elegant solutions whenever possible. While general and “futureproof” designs are worthwhile objectives, don’t overdo it. When we “futureproof” too much then our data structures get unwieldy - and they are unlikely to meet future needs on the first iteration anyways.

My code was also used as a reference by infra team when VNC pipeline was built. 

Drove the job platform results service design and implementation since March. Worked closely with upstream service provider within JP and downstream users from simulation, localization, infra teams to clarify requirements and continuously enhance design. Set high standard to implementation of results service, continuously pushed myself to refactor the implementation to be more type safe, cleaner and more readable, and make components more loosely coupled. Finished REST APIs implementation and testing within planned time. 

Contributed to enhancing simulation dashboard performance and reduced query time from multiple minutes to a few seconds. 

Contributed to on-tactical rotation of job platform and defined request handling process.  

Formalizing post-mortem template to enhance off-board team's engineering excellence. 

During this 6 months, my technical leadership has obvious growth. I came from .Net and monolith world. Now I am able to build micro-services in Java with the advanced Java technologies such as Dagger2 and JOOQ. I enjoyed working with Yan to learn from him the recommended Java coding styles and infrastructures. I also learnt from Lee the efficient way to gather user requirements -- guiding users to clarify their requirements, and applied this learning to my design of job platform results service. Instead of asking users to tell me what they want, I created mock web pages to provide them visual guidance for them to confirm their requirements, and add/remove features from there. Individual meetings with different user teams instead of trying to get everybody in the same meeting also helped to close my design faster. ",,,Cindy Cao,ccao@argo.ai,Cindy Cao,ccao@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"- Cindy is a very hardworking individual and puts in a lot of efforts to accomplish all the tasks that she is responsible to deliver. 
- I have seen her work tirelessly to build the initial video generation pipeline for the Triage team. It 
was a challenging task since it involved a lot of uncertainties and stuff which she was not familiar with. She tried her best to explore all the options to ensure that the video pipeline worked and could actually be used to Triage road events on a regular basis. 
- Cindy is keen on learning new technologies/tools and does not hesitate taking upon new challenges and explore arenas which she has not dealt with. 
- She has always helped the team with good documentation. She is very helpful and does not mind sharing her knowledge when someone seeks her help. ",,,Shreyas Nagaraj,snagaraj@argo.ai,Cindy Cao,ccao@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Cindy's biggest strength of all time is her will of not giving up and getting to the solution for a problem. As part of the Triage project, I have seen Cindy work very hard to make the Video Generation pipeline successful. This was not an easy problem to solve and she worked very hard on it. 

Cindy has grown and made improvements in her skills in the language Python as well become familiar with the AV side of things. She has helped discover a lot of bugs and problems with original Argonaut and visualization tools. She became really familiar with Terraform and scripting while developing a solution for the pipeline.

Cindy has grown on how to cross-collaborate across the team as part of her project she had to do a lot of cross-collaborations. This has allowed her to grow and learn how to call out dependencies.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"I could have done better in being more aggressive clarifying user requirements when designing job platform results service. At the initial stage of designing results service, I tended to discuss more internally with teammates and TL to understand requirements. Although I also asked what their requirements are during meetings in Pittsburgh with tracking, localization, infra, mapping teams, without a clear picture, they could only give me very high level answers. So this was not the most effective approach. Then I learnt to provide a vision to users and guide them to clarify requirements. This way worked out better.

I want to improve personal influence in off-board group and bigger scope software teams by hosting technical topic sessions to demonstrate my technical expertise and become a know-how of these areas: Java, Postgres, Druid, Docker, Kubernetes. Looking at the past 6 months, I spent too much time working in front of computer but not enough time communicating so my value and my deliverables were probably not visible enough. Reputation builds on top of visibility. In order to advance my career, I should drive communications more actively. 

I also would like to contribute more to interview for off-board team. 

Becoming an Argo reader is another goal of my next 6 months.

   *When the stereo camera pair becomes the major option for the Z2 near field sensing, there is a need to quickly complete the evaluations of various image sensors and the illumination source for dark field sensing. I was assigned to support the camera technical lead to quickly perform verification tests.

   *When it becomes clear that the stereo camera's dynamic tolerance can significantly impact the performance, I performed the sensor alignment study to quantify the impact. I performed thermal stress analysis for both far-field and near-field stereo camera mount structures to provide a design baseline that minimize the dynamic tolerances. 

* There is also a need to understand whether the IR source and the built-in camera filter can be use to enhance image capture in a dark field. I performed the IR test and the eye safety analysis to define the LED selection criteria.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Cindy started off at Argo reporting to me and working on a variety of tasks while I was still leading radar, interface to Velodyne, and ultrasonics. 

Her first tasks were within radar. She jumped in quickly and made substantial progress in building software tools and test plans and setups to evaluate Z1 radar modules and designs.  Despite her disdain for Michigan winters, she made the trek and executed testing and provided important insights through her analysis of the resulting data.  She also performed a study into mounting and alignment tolerance stackups for Z1 radar that helped to inform mounting and placement designs.  She also had to work with a challenging partner in Aptiv to understand and develop decoders for CAN data from the poorly documented development firmwares used in our radar system, and contend with little support from software to get tests up and running.  She grew her understanding of the underlying principles of operation as a means to improve her work on testing and analysis. Her rapid and substantive contributions to this work exceeded my expectations of her in such a short time. 

Her focus then shifted to leading work on the Argo side for the ultrasonic system being designed with Valeo and Ford for deployment at Z1.  She developed tools for analyzing data reported from the prototype vehicle and generated an extremely comprehensive test plan to evaluate the system designed by Valeo.  As I moved away towards focusing on Argo Lidar I lost touch with progress on that front.  Since then, she's picked up a number of important, if somewhat disparate, work streams that benefit from her mix of coding and analytical capabilities, project ownership, and dedication.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Cindy is an outstanding Engineer. It seems like she has more than one job because she works on more than one portion of hardware. She does, lidar, radar, ultrasonics and more. I had the opportunity to work with her on a couple of projects and the experience was very good. She was always open to feedback on her work and was open to questions at all times.  CIndy is very diligent with her work which came in handy during our interaction. Due to her diligence, I was able to perform her tests with almost no issues. Often times I am given a test procedure and have to spend hours debugging software issues before the tests can be run. I have never had this issue with Cindy's test requests. Here are some of Cindy's highlights:

-  Worked closely with Valeo to get their ultrasonics system working in a manner that is in the direction of what is desired for the Z1 design and beyond. This required multiple tweaks and configurations. 
- Developed a program that decoded the raw CAN data from the ultrasonics system that Valeo created and converted this data into a plot.   This was useful during the ultrasonics testing that was performed, as we could see the output data within seconds. 
- Radar development testing

Cindy supported on Z1 with analyzing the radar tolerance stackup in order to understand the risk of coverage gaps with unfavorable stackups.  

For Z2, Cindy has significantly contributed to the sensor selection process including work summarized in the go/Z2FoV document.  She quickly got up to speed using the Blensor tool which was instrumental in understanding the true coverage constraints associated with lidar.  She helped create documentation throughout the Z2 sensor selection process to facilitate frequent touchpoints.  

For recent Tiara work, Cindy has supported to gain a better understanding of the feasibility of the dynamic tolerances being specified for stereo cameras.  She was able to apply her FEA skills to creating analysis to understand what would be needed in a design to meet the tolerances.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"There are two areas that could use improvement:

1. Presentation style/summary - Cindy's presentations are very rigorous and full of wonderful detail, but that comes with the double-edged sword of a new reader with no context not knowing what results/conclusions should be drawn from the documentation. 
Deliberately making a point to always have 1-3 slides at the front that capture (1) context for why the sensor is being tested, (2) the sensor's expected performance as it relates to _specific use cases_, and (3) whether that performance is expected to carry over into future iterations/tests of that sensing modality (in other words, are the results optimistic or pessimistic? what caveats in the testing setup were there?) will help a lot. (3) is particularly key since the company as a whole is working with three different generations of vehicles, and there's a tendency for people to skim a deck and take away what they want to take away.
The Ultrasound test report is an example of a document that does the intro slides very well, and the Lidar Beam Projection and near-field stereo camera tests are examples of the initial intro/summary slides lacking.

2. Eliciting information from stakeholders (not just HW and Systems, but SW as well) to tie the results of each sensor test result together. I mention this because Cindy is lead on prioritizing/matrixing test plans across sensing modalities (e.g. radar, USS, NF stereo) for various use cases. So, I'd love to see testing/results for each modality couched in terms of (1) specific AV use cases and (2) the expected performance of other sensors in those use cases.

Both 1/2 are easily addressed by (1) continued exposure to the AV problem + the notion that many of the system parameters are very flexible and (2) continued interaction with stakeholders external to hardware + learning what issues in particular concern each team (e.g. Systems vs. ML vs. Tracking/Prediction, for example).

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"I was in the Performance Analysis team when I first joined Argo. After re-organization, I'm in the new STS team and sometimes provide support/maintenance for old PA work.

**STS**

- Implemented multiple processes for better traceability of scenarios which address the following problems:
 i) how to exhaustively track scenarios in different develop status (e.g develop, modifications, other branches) over time.
 ii) checking compliance with STS's metadata conventions.
 iii) ability to change test set tags aside from yaml which facilitates the management of scenarios lifecycle.
[code link](https://github.com/argoai/scenarios/blob/develop/scripts/scenarios-status/load_new_yamls_to_db.py#L106)

- Created ScenarioFinder dashboard (go/scenario-finder) to help developers find scenarios of interest by various searching criteria; Created FeatureCoverage dashboard (http://metrics.argoai.tools/dashboard/269) to help visualize to what extend each autonomy feature is tested by scenarios.

- Designs for tools/processes to enable integration tests using scenarios and metrics for AV software based on autonomy features. Proposed solutions for workflow from selecting scenarios and metrics to interact with JP to run by stages. I am implementing the first stage of the plan, which is the new Scenario Finder tool.
[Doc link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11qrv4YzRwh4oT2w0z5xZOS-VuEFNJ2wC2UXE8lM9Y9I/edit?usp=sharing)

- Created scenarios to support feature development (e.g. lane change, intersections) by MP for 3/29 demo. And constantly refine scenario tagging to better describe scenarios and review scenarios created along with the involvement of AV software.

- Implemented the first-cut general metrics owned by STS which leverages multiple existing log analysis modules as well as tools created by SimEng.

**Performance Analysis**

- Investigated several dashboard services and chose Metabase as the in-house reporting tool used by the whole company. Set up and configured the Metabase Service, and provided maintenance for it at first stage.

- Implemented and currently maintains the workflow for log data which powers almost all logs related dashboards (e.g mileage, triage), including:
 i) the logic to dynamically select logs in parquet to run
 ii) abstracting general functions that facilitate the process to extract, transform, and load info from logs using Spark and DB

- Built multiple system-level general metrics including takeovers, task crashes, resources usage etc to help describe and track AV system performance overtime/release. Did data validations on various methods to identify takeovers and on different sources of mileage reporting. Collaborated with other teams like INF, Detection, Localization etc to provide customized sub-system level metrics/tools to investigate specific issues like kick-outs, crashes during code-red. Provided feedback for peers to optimize their SQL queries.

- Implemented processes that leverage multiple source channels (e.g. files in S3, spark jobs) to check log ingestion status. And created a dashboard to summarize log ingestion status as well as various exceptions.

She has been always very responsive in fixing issues I found on the dashboard, including weekends. Claire is a quick learner. She picked up Spark very quickly and is one of the key contributors to the Performance Analysis code base. ",,,Yuhang Wang,ywang@argo.ai,Claire Wu,cwu@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"- Claire helped the Performance analysis team in building the metrics ETL. She also gave the Triage team vital inputs while building the Triage ETL - especially while integrating the Triage ETL workflow with the Luigi jobs. This had a significant impact because the Triage ETL serves as the main data source for the Triage Applications
- Claire helped the Triage team monitor the Triage ETL and was very responsive when there were any issues.
- She worked with the data-core team and ensured that the Metrics & Triage ETLs were up and running on the spark cluster all the time. 
- She is very approachable and helped me a more than a few times by sharing her experiences and learnings while building the analytics pipelines. 

*Summary:* Knowing that she is a Software Engineer 1 - I strongly feel that she is already operating at the next level and hence might be a good candidate for a promotion. I am confident that she will continue to be a good asset to the PA team & I will look forward to collaborate with her when needed. ",,,Shreyas Nagaraj,snagaraj@argo.ai,Claire Wu,cwu@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Claire contributions were very significant for her Software Engineer 1 level.  When the Performance Analysis team first spun up, Claire had the most experience with actually implementing databases.  During the initial months, Claire was arguably the main driver on the performance analysis team in getting the different pieces working at the nuts and bolts level.  She identified Metabase as a good initial tool to get the first dashboards set up and she also spearheaded getting the infrastructure set up to connect the ingested Parquet files to the dashboards including getting a separate performance analysis database set up, setting up the scripts to extract calculations from the parquet files and getting chron jobs set up to regularly run the jobs.  

After the transition to the STS team, Claire has continued to take on many of the pieces of work to manage larger scale tracking of the scenario database across different data sources.  She has written a variety of tools to search the scenario database from a Metabase dashboard, perform initial calculations of scenario coverage, and perform updates to how features are tagged.  

Overall, Claire has implemented a large number of pieces required to make our developing systems work together.  She needs minimal oversight on most of the tasks and often implements pieces that she knows are needed without needed to be explicitly tasked (for example during the initial set up of the performance analysis pipeline). ",,,Tim McGee,tmcgee@argo.ai,Claire Wu,cwu@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Claire has consistently found and/or created tools that match (and often anticipate) the needs of the group and the company as a whole.  Examples;

- Metabase framework itself, finding and setting it up.  This has taken some flak but not much considering how widely it is used, and that it was actually set up as a stopgap for $0 license fee (as opposed to replacement pro suites proposed which are $100k+/yr license fees).  Not saying it should not eventually be supplanted, but given the critical needs it has served so far, Claire deserves some serious kudos for finding, setting up, disseminating.
- PA metrics database structure and many scripts that populate it with key metrics (e.g. log ingestion, task-related metrics, takeover instances).
- Aggressively taking on development on scenario management scripts and dashboards",,,David Lenkner,dlenkner@argo.ai,Claire Wu,cwu@argo.ai,Software,

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"I think that continuing to work on generating good clean code should still be an area for improvement for Claire.

Specifically, she should strive to think about how she would write code for someone who doesn't know the domain and systems that she's working with (because, that will frequently be the case until her team gets some readers).  Part of this is also probably doing a better job of giving context behind changes in pull requests -- Specifically not just saying _what_ is being done but _why_ it is being done.  This would be helpful for me anyway.

The other thing that goes into ""good clean code"" is probably just getting more experience around how to write good clean abstraction layers.  It's really hard to know exactly how much of your abstraction to expose vs. how much to leave as-is.  I think this is something that Claire is improving on, but I think that there is still room for improvement here.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"- Better communications to the team

When we first started STS, I felt I did not present results and progress well to the team thus caused some redundant checks from teammates during our daily sync meetings. Afterwards, I communicate my progress or work plan that's worth attention via team slack channel as well as written docs to collect feedback and keep folks sync'ed.

- Data management

At PA team, when we first created DB tables, relevant tables are loosely connected with the main table and there's also limited amount of restrains on those tables. Those loosely constructed tables made data governance difficult as more tables got introduced and multiple processes modified the same table. As a lesson learned, when we created tables for STS, we implemented more constraints into the schema to emphasize data integrity and help check the accuracy of our scripts.",,,Claire Wu,cwu@argo.ai,Claire Wu,cwu@argo.ai,Software,

Claire is often not very proactively vocal in meetings.  This is an area that cuts both ways.  The team should make sure we give Claire enough chances to speak also.  I think we do a reasonable job, but this is something we should continuously monitor.  

Another minor area that I think will improve with experience is doing sanity checks on results or scenarios.  One example was a set of scenarios with small/medium/large spacing for cars in a chain.  The small one had cars that were driving at speed bumper to bumper, which wasn't physically realistic.  There was one other case that I can't remember the details of with one of the metrics that had a bug that was apparent. I want to say it was something like a fraction of some events that was > 1.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"My starting date was January 15th. During this period, I have successfully touched and improved multiple pieces of core infrastructure that have had org wide effects. I have met my targets, which can be tracked by my Jira tickets and PRs, with small slips in schedule. My process has been to pull design consideration from team members, guide the technical direction/implementation of my projects, and support an active review cycle to finalize implementations.

My switch to the RAD team has presented me with the opportunity to learn new skill sets, particularly in:
* CI processes
* python scripting
* bash scripting

Most notably, I am often assisting fellow developers and VO's with infrastructural problems related to building, testing, and deployment. My confidence has grown during this time, especially in regards to proposing technical approaches.

**Achievements**

Two weeks after my start date I was working on the vehicles, debugging new features and assisting peers with AV code during code red. During this time I delivered my first component, core file management, which touched multiple components: core task management, argo IPC, deployment, and car os. This is a critical piece that needs to work 100% of the time, we don't want to miss elusive core dumps.

Afterwards, I started on my next component - compute hardware monitor. This component had to be iterated a few times to achieve higher performance numbers, ballooning into requiring the installation and configuration of the Intel PCM library. This required modifying the car os, testing the deployment process using the swan server, and C++ infrastructure code for aggregating computing hw monitor statistics. The effort was worth it, this component has been used multiple times,  most recently to detect thermal throttling on halocreeks and VO laptops.

Halfway through the cycle, I was moved to the devtools to team to support infrastructure of deployment, developer environments, and the build system. My first major change was to clean up our docker images, and finalize a clear dependency tree between our many images. This prepared me for the next major step which was to remove unique include paths for each of our external libraries. This reduced our compile command size by 50%, reducing the number of filesystem queries a build command must do. I have begun to improve the strictness of our dependency tree, by enforcing proper usage of cmake for dependencies (internal and external). These are no small tasks, requiring reviews and support of multiple teams.

My work on the build system was self guided, fueled by inadequacies and pitfalls I saw while utilizing our infrastructure. At this point, I am the go-to person regarding build questions and requests.

I am particularly proud of my addition to the CI cycle with the removal of the install step for unit testing. Our build system would always install our unit tests, which translated into moving around 40 gigabytes of data 3 times (one for each sanitizer). The process took 5 minutes of every CI job, which average 30 minutes. By removing the install step for our unit tests, we have proactively prepared our growing code base.

Most recently, I finished a simulation overhaul. Drawing from the amazing infra developed in ShipIt!, I exposed this infrastructure as an independent library and leveraged it in a simulations script. The new script reduces the time it takes to get started in simulation, ensures that there is no confusion which configuration a simulation is in by automatically utilizing your local repo configuration, and removes redundant commands to simplify usage for new users.

**Improvements**
Coming from a small company, I haven't had much experience with code reviews, criticism and having to explain my technical decisions. During my first cycle here, I have learned a great deal in these area making me a better software engineer.

At first, I was afraid of code reviews and saw them as a roadblock to my development. However, as the weeks have gone by I've begun to really enjoy the personal challenge of presenting a PR to my peers that has minimal requested changes. I have begun to see code reviews as an amazing tool for pushing personal growth and accountability of the content I create. 

During my first few code reviews, I was very defensive. The caliber at Argo is very high, and people take the time to offer constructive criticism to others. I took a step back and began forcing myself to accept the criticism without argument. It was amazing, I didn't always agree with the suggested reviews but it was important for me to learn how to accept different approaches. The result has been an improved view of software engineering thanks to multiple alternative perspectives and a fire hose of new technical information.

Most importantly, coming into a new company of this size and caliber, my confidence was diminished. At first I would often ask ""is this the right way to do it?"". However, over the past few months, I've slowly came back to my original technical process of presenting a solution, iterating quickly and determining next steps with less need for confirmation that my approach is valid.",,,Constantin Savtchenko,csavtchenko@argo.ai,Constantin Savtchenko,csavtchenko@argo.ai,Software,

* Has worked through improvements to the build system and development tools methodically and rigorously. This includes not only following feature requests, but leveraging past expertise to identify additional changes which lead to the desired result but are not directly stated in the initial request. High level desires for faster or more accurate build systems resulted in introducing changes which produced these results (e.g. reducing the number of include search paths in the build system) without needing hand holding to find these technical solutions.

Constantin has great energy, drive, and passion when he is attempting to tackle a problem or fix and issue in the code or build system. I always feel that I can count on him and that he will be there to help me, even with the most trivial problem.  Once example was a Friday evening when we were trying to diagnose some CI issues and change out some of the settings.  He stayed in the office and supported me as much as he could until almost midnight!  I know that CI isn't his speciality or an area of interested, but he was still there helping out me, the team, and the organization and that says a lot about him.  I think that Constantin's background and technical skills are a huge asset to our team.  The team relies upon him to help work on problems and projects in my diverse areas, such as C++ unit tests, Python build scripts, and car deployments.  It is great to have a technical asset that is able to bounce around such diverse areas and contribute at high level.  I personally enjoy working with Constantin.

While his experience is not necessarily at the os/hardware level, he was able to complete things like the pcm hardware monitor and core file management. He did this all while coming up to speed on many new infrastructure components.

Constantin is a very hard worker who is self motivated. While working on the hardware monitor, he came across numerous roadblocks our deployment infrastructure. He pushed through this and came to a reasonable solution with good communication to me about his decision making. Some others might complain or demand help to modify the deployment system, but he took this upon himself.

Constantin also takes pride in his work and is never shy about communicating problems he finds( in most cases fixing them). He is always willing to help solve problems for others.",,,Mike Dacko,mdacko@argo.ai,Constantin Savtchenko,csavtchenko@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"One of my favorite parts of Argo is how reliant it is that we, as engineers, are motivated to provide not only technical solutions but technical designs as well. Argo relies on the creativity of all its engineer to succeed.  Currently I remain focused on completing tasks and improving our infrastructure, however my focus for the upcoming cycle is to also focus on suggesting new direction, and have more input on what technical challenges we need to address. I am preemptively tackling and presenting difficulties I see with our build system but I would like to extend my input to our deployment infrastructure.

One of the more difficult parts of Argo is the amount of information flying around at a particular time (via Slack). It's easy to get sucked into all the different conversations going on, and get excited to be involved. This has led me to speaking up too early before I am 100% confident of my response and being easily distracted. I have improved on this front already, but I'd like to continue my efforts to maintain focus on engineering time vs time spent checking email, doing code reviews or answering questions on slack.

Lastly, it is my personal goal to become a Python reader (and if I do end up doing C++ again) a C++ reader (which I have much more experience with).

He is willing to take trips where ever in order to help resolve an issue or to just help out in general. Corey has been a big helping hand in the vehicle integration ops team with numerous things. He is a team worker and these are the types of people that we need at Argo. In the earlier times at Argo, roles were not very clearly defined, so Corey was all over the place with. He was able to handle that pretty well. Now that the company is growing and maturing, the roles and responsibilities are becoming more focused.

I totally understand the fact that when you are a vehicle integration person, you can get caught up with an issue and the next thing you know, you have been debugging a car for an hour or two. 

Another improvement that Corey could use is learning more about the software tools here at Argo, as he mentioned in his own review. There is nothing like collecting some data that needs to be evaluated and you have to wait for a software engineer to evaluate it. Learning the software tools may be outside of the scope of an integration engineer, but I feel like having this tool under his tool belt would make him that much more proficient at his job.",,,Bryan Barnette,bbarnette@argo.ai,Corey Bowman,cbowman@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"I feel that I have made a significant contribution to the timely completion of the Commerce rebuilding after Ford moved out following the announcement we had secured the lease.  With the timing of orders from Continental Office of furniture I proactively set in motion having all of the furniture delivered and installed at Commerce in January. As well as getting quotes to set up for painting, white board installation, exhaust fan, air hose reels as well as some economical soft seating and repositioning of soft seating from Federal needed for the Commerce location. Procured Team requested picnic tables and brighter more secure lighting. Provided Team requested rotation of the snacks provided and put in motion the installation of a dishwasher to take place in May.  Set up Culligan water service at the Commerce location for Team requested, easier filling of water tank on the Jura machine.  Placed toiletries amenities in both the men’s and women’s room. Procured the Team requested weight bench with matting.  For safety I had another electrical outlet placed in the garage to stop extension cords being placed in an entryway path.  Set up meetings with Ford Land and Fairlane Grounds to establish processes and procedures with these groups. I did learn that I needed to ensure that the contractor follows exact directions regardless of the quote provided. I also learned that timing commitments is not something I can depend upon with the property management teams and I must proactively work with each team to ensure the best for ARGO AI.  I feel that I have worked very well with this group and it shows in the timing being improved at both locations for contracted work.
I currently serve on the Event Committee and 401K Committee.
I worked successfully with the Event Committee Team for ARGO Kids Take Over Day.  As well, I’m working with the team on events such as the 2nd Annual ARGO/Ford/Roush Picnic, the Company Picnic and quarterly fun events for the Team.
I support the Team by working with the property manager to troubleshoot, coordinate repair work with Ford Land and Fairlane Grounds.  As well as order and stock all supplies from break room to office supplies.
I work with the Property Manager and Ford ticketing system to ensure safety on exterior of building as well as to be sure that the landscaping is maintained.
I was able to find and gain approval, from the Property Manager, to use our sound masking contractor saving ARGO AI $18,540.95 and ensuring confidentiality of our facility.
Other successful projects completed on time: Safety Data Sheets and binders, Break Room & Conference Room consistency.  Working with the catering company and the team to provide quality choices to include favorite meals.  Setting up and organizing our new game room for the Team with the requested items.  Receiving approval, purchasing and placing of a massage chair that is utilized daily by the team.  Working with the hardware team to order, assemble and place the items that they need to perform their job, including items such as humidity strips, anti static lotion, bin labeling and shelving placement.  Providing the server room with humidity sticks.  Beginning the Shipt program for shopping so I can be of more assistance to the Team. (This program delivers the groceries so I can be here to open the office and have it it order).
I always try to keep a positive attitude to show how much I enjoy my job.  I come to work every day with a smile on my face.
I strive to congratulate others in their successes.  When the Team needs encouragement, I motivate them to keep going. (2 Spot Peer Awards written)
I have had co-workers from Facilities, People Ops and Finance reach out to me when they needed a fresh look or perspective on things. It has been a valuable learning experience all the way around.
I don’t rely on common methods to solve a problem, but address each situation with a fresh perspective. As well, I take day to day tasks and challenge the status quo to find improvements that can be made.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Over the past six months I worked with Dane on tasks surrounding the development of the Z1 ITM and CMS modules. Dane was a major contributor to the planning and ESOW effort for the ITM module. In particular, Dane contributed to the design of the lidar power supply and schematic/design reviews. Dane was also a major contributor to the development of packaging and placement requirements for the Z2 CMS module.

Dane lead Z2 workshop discussions about time synchronization system design and the considerations around moving from IEEE1588 to 802.1as for the network time sync protocol. He is known across the organization as a technical expert on network time sync design.

Although Dane has transitioned to more FPGA work over the past six months, he has still helped debug hardware issues with the initial Z1 ITM modules. Dane continues to demonstrate technical expertise across a wide range of domains, from electrical design, FGPAs, embedded software, and he consistently provides valuable design insight and advice.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"During this review cycle, I have worked with Dane on ITM, VLS128 implementation to Z0, and CMS placement discussions. 

Dane, thought of the idea of including the IMU within Argo Lidar and drove discussions to keep this door open, that also brought up the conversation of how to better package ITM with the VLS128 for Z2.  He continued to contribute to the discussions to how to best implement ITM for both lidar options.  

When working to implement VLS128I on the Z0-Fleet, Dane quickly jumped in to help support how to handle the differences electrically with VLP32-C and insuring no issues with the PITT module in how the implementation was completed.

Dane led discussions on the placement optimization for CMS and helped be sure all the correctly people were involved to reach an optimal solution.  He provided valuable insight on the factors that needed to be considered in the decision and helped to drive resolution.

Given my lack of knowledge in the area, I don't directly have knowledge of Dane's work on SGU, but consistently see him working hard to get through the issues, reaching out to the various parties involved and driving solutions.

Dane is the kind of colleague you like to work with.  Always willing to brainstorm and coming up with creative ideas to address issues.  Willing to jump in and help support on things.  Brings up issues and ask good questions to be sure things are not falling through the cracks.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Dane is one of the first people I interacted with at Argo and is one of the key people that helped me get up to speed on our AVS system.  We’ve worked together primarily on the SGU project, and in the 3 months since I’ve joined, he has always been quick to respond to any questions or issues that I’ve had related to SGU FPGA and embedded SW designs.

Dane has been deeply involved in the SGU development as a whole, starting with defining the SGU requirements specification, which has been the foundation for our internal development and for the development by our design services partner DornerWorks.  He has also been heavily involved in the technical development for the SGU, with some of his key accomplishments in this area including integration of the PoC ISP pipeline, which was used as the baseline for the DornerWorks, and the development of the ARM embedded SW for managing the pipeline.  He has also helped to de-risk the SGU development and to guide the micro-architecture definition by completing focused PoCs of various components of the SGU.  This include designs that validate the functionality of PTP on Xilinx MPSoC (largely undocumented by Xilinx), the PCIe host interface (used by the infrastructure software team for initial driver development), and GMSL2 camera bringup (leveraged for initial validation of the Alpha and A sample cameras).   

Through these projects, Dane has shown that he is a strong well rounded engineer that can be effective in broad areas such as FPGA firmware development, embedded software, circuit design, and hardware bringup.  Dane’s influence on the SGU implementation has been significant, and I believe he consistently performs above his current grade level.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"Though I feel my communication has improved from the previous cycle, I still feel I need to work on sharing all pertinent knowledge of the systems I am working on with team and cross-functional members. I often get so caught up in the technical details that I can forget that those details are not immediately obvious to anyone coming into the project.

Additionally, I have a tendency to attempt to push through roadblocks and problems on my own instead of leaning on FAEs, supplier support teams, or even occasionally other team members. Though often I find I understand the problem better when I solve it myself, it does tend to take more time and leads to convoluted 'magic solutions' that are difficult to replicate or communicate during handoff.

SGU has been the greatest challenge thus far, due primarily to its extremely compressed timeline, but it is quickly demonstrating that a lot of knowledge gleaned from working with the system has not been documented or transferred to the software people who will be working on it. While the hardware team is still trying to get their head around the proper way to get the system up and running (which doesn't lend itself to documentation), I feel I could have done a much better job gently introducing the software team to their new platform instead of flinging a board at them and saying 'you have my slack handle'.",,,Dane Bennington,dbennington@argo.ai,Dane Bennington,dbennington@argo.ai,Hardware,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Since my last performance review, a number of things have changed in terms of my role at Argo AI: the LME team has substantially increased in size, the focus of my work has shifted from soley working on labeling tools to primarily working on mapping tools to being a team lead for the Map Tools team and now (as of April 5, 2018) managing both the Mapping and Labeling tools teams with eight direct reports.

Starting in November of 2018, the focus of my work changed from labeling tools to mapping tools when Brad Krupa and myself were tasked with standing up the initial set of tools needed to create the Argo AI Vector Map - the Road Editor and Lane Editor. For these applications, I was the primary developer on the Lane Editor while Brad was the primary developer on the Road Editor. Both of these tools were developed in tandem which was less than ideal from a code standardization perspective, however, I strived to keep things uniform by introducing the idea of a “Vector Map Object” base class, a standardized API dictionary, and generalized data/presentation modules/components. In a matter of weeks, Brad and myself delivered the first cut of the tools which were immediately utilized to create Argo AI’s first Vector Map.

In early December 2018, the LME organization was split into three subteams and I was given the role of Team Lead for the Map Tools team with two direct reports. Over the course of the next six weeks, the team continued to iterate on the Road and Lane Editor and developed two additional tools needed to complete the Vector Map: the Lane Conflict Editor and Set/Subset/Lane Association (SSLA) Editor. For these tools, I was the primary developer on the Lane Conflict Editor while I continued to oversee, prioritize, and implement features/improvements on all Mapping Tools. 

While leading the Map Tools team, I ensured to continuously elicit feedback from Jess/Patrick and the LMP team in order to ensure that feature development was focused on improving the usefulness of the tools as well as efficiency of Vector Map production. Additionally, I have strived to ensure smooth releases by coordinating documentation updates, providing detailed releases notes, and performing smoke-testing. 

Over the last few months, the Map Tools team has responding to the organizational need of accelerated mapping efforts by continually hardening the existing map tools and creating new tools to assist in mapping efforts/efficiency (i.e. ArgoView, KML Map Viewer, Signal Face Reviewer). I have continued to focus the team on addressing code health by implementing/requiring unit testing (which was sacrificed in late 2017) on all pull requests, standardizing map-server interactions, and converting the codebase to TypeScript. These changes not only enable improved development time in the future, but they also elicit a sense of pride for all members working in the codebase. This sense of pride can be seen in the quality of pull requests coming from every member of the Map Tools team. 

In April of 2018, I took over management of the Labeling tools team and brought on an additional five direct reports. While it is too early to judge my work on this team, in the next few months I hope to bring the same standardization, pride, and positive attitude that I feel I have helped nurture on the Map Tools team.

Some additional accomplishments not listed in the long-winded paragraphs above:


* Implemented standardized file server which is utilized on all triage, labeling, and mapping static web applications. Allows environment variable based configuration for static web applications so that new versions of an application do not have to be built per environment. 

* Onboarded William Lai, Henry Burke Sweet, and Matt Mahan

* Provided ongoing mentoring to others (direct reports + John Linahan (intern))

* Hardened map-server infrastructure: separated dev only environment to dev + prod environment and documented database refresh process

* Took lead on resolving all Traffic Light related issues after SAIPS traffic light localization pipeline broke down and we did not have a fallback

* Became a JavaScript/TypeScript reader

Accomplishments & Strengths ,report,"Since starting in January, Dan has been essential to getting me up to speed, and integrated into the day to day here at Argo. Dan has gone out of his way to help me. He has taken time to explain processes, use cases, and explain what the importance and impact new feature will have on what teams. Dan was also initially my Welcome Buddy.

Since I have been here Dan has taken on a large workload. Somehow he has been able to manage coordination across teams, triage issues from LMP and other groups, plan future sprints, manage Jira tickets and update boards, along with answering questions and completing his own sprint work. His ability to multi-task and prioritize issues has been crucial to getting projects complete and meeting deadlines. 

When issues within a Map Tool product arise Dan is usually the initial point of contact. This includes an initial assessment of the problem, and if applicable creating a Jira ticket for the issue. Rarely there is a loss of data with the issue or corruption of the data, but when this happens Dan has gone the additional steps to help correct and rectify the data.

One area that I have been impressed with how Dan handles is planning for the future. This includes Sprint planning, but also includes implementation of new features. When one feature will rely on another, the planning of completion and start dates are already taken into consideration  before work is even started on the first feature. This meticulous planning has been visible when looking ahead at the plans for Q2. Dan's planning for our group compared to other groups has been evident in the differing degrees of details.

When I started, the Map Tools team only had one Reader. Dan saw this area as lacking and recently applied to be a reader and was approved. 

When Dan is able to not be in meetings, he is able to contribute code to the Map Tools. Lately this has resulted in new features such as a Pedestrian Crossing tool. Along with coding, Dan has been working to coordinate a change in the structure of our repositories. Dan also takes responsibility for deploying our new versions of our products.

During 1 on 1 meetings Dan makes sure to check in on issues week to week. Anything that was brought up the prior week, he makes sure to see where the issue stands this week. Any action items that he sees an ability to help with, he takes action on them quickly to help unblock anything that he can. Along with this Dan takes time to walk through future work and address how it should be implemented and what implementation decisions need to be accounted for to help reduce questions in the future, along with reducing broken compatibility.

Since the last review cycle, Dan has become a reader for JavaScript & TypeScript, which is a testament to his knowledge in JS and ability to ramp up on it's statically typed variant. In addition to 'just reading' code, I often see Dan testing out PRs to see how features function/feel firsthand in order to provide with his feedback.  As a peer, that's something that is always appreciated before landing a feature.

Dan is very supportive from a professional/personal growth standpoint.  In our weekly one on one sessions, he is always receptive to discussing with what's working well and what's not with my current projects and within the team to make things run smoothly.  I feel that he values and seriously considers the input that I provide when we discuss the structure/architecture of our projects",,,Ryan Waskiewicz,rwaskiewicz@argo.ai,Dan Fitzpatrick,dfitzpatrick@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,report,"Beginning at the end of November, Dan assumed the role of lead of the Mapping sub-team beneath the LME umbrella.  Since then:

* Dan has driven the rollout of a variety of new applications, such as the SSLA Editor, Lane Conflict Editor, Signal Face Reviewer, and more.  This set of tools makes up most of the current suite of mapping tools and has allowed us to make substantial improvements to the mapping pipeline.

* Dan has also been the primary manager of the infrastructure of the mapping tools.  He has been responsible for creating new applications and deploying new versions of applications into the DC/OS cluster.  He has also been responsible for distributing release notes to stakeholders of the LME Applications

* More recently, Dan has been working on creating a design for splitting up the LME repositories into a set of more focused repositories.  This should improve the build-times of LME applications and speed up the iteration time that we are able to achieve.  

* Dan has also recently become a reader.  This is significant because a major pain point within the mapping team has been getting code landed into develop.  Dan took it upon himself to gain readership so he could assist in this endeavor and increase our development rate.

* Also recently, Dan has taken over leadership of the Labeling team, with the transition of Randy Warner to the visualization team.  This has added a substantial amount of work and planning to Dan's plate, and he has willingly taken it on and has continued to produce code and designs for the team.

* More personally, Dan has repeatedly worked to open up new opportunities for potential growth to me.  He has given me opportunities to explore new technologies (Adding a leaflet-based slippy map to our application), paid close attention to our code health (continues to support typescript conversions), and supports the development of his team members (has recently suggested I devote time to becoming a better peer reviewer and gain readership).  

* Dan spends significant amounts of time planning and is very transparent with his developers about what the expectations of them are.  He provides weekly updates in 1:1 meetings and gives us plenty of heads up when a substantial project is in the pipeline.  This allows us to be proactive in preparing for larger tasks that are coming our way.",,,Brad Krupa,bkrupa@argo.ai,Dan Fitzpatrick,dfitzpatrick@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"- When I joined in February, Dan's team had, by far, the most structure within LME.  Jira stories were sized, with clear descriptions and acceptance criteria.  Map Tools (his only team at that time) was the most cross-trained (e.g., low bus factor).
- Upon taking on leadership of the Labeling team, he immediately began addressing bus factor issues and strengthening Scrum practices (clearer story descriptions, a higher focus on retrospecting the previous sprint in sprint planning)
- Dan will take on issues and drive them relentlessly to completion.  He has done this with traffic light issues multiple times, creating ad-hoc processes to get the work done to unblock map production.
- Keeps a focus on long-term software maintainability, including increasing code reuse where it makes sense (examples: yeoman generator, generic VectorMapObject reducer) and high unit test coverage.
- He maintains an exceptionally positive attitude even amidst challenges and time constraints
- Of LME TLs, he is the only one who updated Sprint Tracker and the Weekly Review team utilization numbers (I would do it manually for the others).  I did not ask him to do this.",,,Michael Riley,mriley@argo.ai,Dan Fitzpatrick,dfitzpatrick@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Dan is killing it, especially for a SWE II / L4! He's been a great partner on LME; I've honestly been much more impressed by his leadership and collaboration than I was with Randy's, who is far more senior. 

Dan has taken a ton of technical work on himself that's for the good of the larger organization: a long push on dev tooling for example, culminating in the (pending) disentanglement of mapping from the unified LME repository, as well as a good start toward continuous deployment.

He has unfailingly dived in to help for things he has nothing to do with. For example I have no history with DCOS, but it's what we're using to run the map server: so when I was having timeouts at 5:30 trying to publish (which involves some half-hour-long computations on the server, in a hanging request), Dan jumped in, explained the load-balancing structure (there were three sets of timeouts in play), and changed them all over for me. Similarly when I was trying to do some performance tuning on the map server, he volunteered to stand up a test replica of our database for me. Basically he has made me look wildly more competent in a non-Google environment than I have any right to!

His work on traffic lights is ludicrous and much appreciated. There was no particular reason it should fall to him to solve traffic lights, or to do them by hand in the meantime, but it somehow did. He has never complained about this, and has stayed late and stayed up with us many nights, labeling by hand or fiddling the positions by hand or with the first creaking automation, and fixing everything up in the database afterward.",,,Seth Porter,symmetry@argo.ai,Dan Fitzpatrick,dfitzpatrick@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"**Delegation**: As I transition into a more management focused position at Argo AI, I need to focus on delegating tasks more effectively. This is sometimes a difficult task for me as I instinctively want to protect my already overburdened team.

**Planning**: There are two areas which I need to address in terms of planning: not over-committing on a sprint-by-sprint basis and working with Tyler and other teams to identify needs. 

Historically, I have planned more work for myself than I can get done in a week given my additional responsibilities. I need to be more realistic in my task assignments and plan for the unexpected. I have already implemented a “punch-list” approach to deal with pop-up work, however, I need to allocate more overhead for unexpected events. 

Additionally, I need to work with Tyler and other teams to better understand the needs of the organization. A good example of this is playing out on the Labeling side of the world right now as other teams are starting to consume label data and have a number of feature requirements.

**Communication**: I need to make it a point to over-communicate to the organization to ensure that others are in the loop on the Mapping and Labeling tools efforts. Additional communication will influence better collaboration between teams and ensure that the team is moving in the right direction.

Unfortunately with the added responsibilities and meetings my 1 one 1 meeting has sometimes now been skipped or started late. Dan is always diligent to make sure we have a 1 on 1 each week, but it has to sometimes be rescheduled. One area to improve is consistently making the meeting, but overall communication and consistency are good.

One other possible change, is with taking on the additional work load I would recommend passing off some of your normal tasks.

In addition to being a people manager (which entails scheduling sprints, creation of JIRA tickets/units of work, syncing with other teams, holding one on ones for two teams, etc.) he's also juggling engineering work (finishing user stories, manually releasing new versions of tools, reading PRs, etc.).  I would love it for Dan to feel free to ask to redistribute some of this work.  Even if it's as simple as asking one of us to manually release a new version of a tool or offload some PR reviews.  Sometimes I think he's trying to keep us as productive as possible (by keeping additional things off our plates), which I definitely appreciate.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Delegation/Mentoring - As he noted, Dan is quick to take on tasks himself.  With a larger team, delegation will be more important, so that he can retain more time for planning and tactical action.  Accelerated mentoring efforts, to not just hand off tasks but develop owners of various systems, particularly on the Labeling side, will help prevent him from becoming overwhelmed by having to continually follow up on each new map production or labeling popup task.  To be clear, he currently has a mentoring focus, but that will look different with 8 direct reports, as opposed to the 3 he had previously only on Map Tools.

Driving decisions - As a leader of multiple groups, it is important to know when to dive in and make a quick, targeted change in direction.  It can be difficult to find the time to think through a new approach to a problem (or an approach to a new problem) and its schedule ramifications, define scope with potential ICs, and get people working all in 24-48 hours.  But I've seen the need for this multiple times (both internally- and executive-driven) in LME, so I expect this will need to be a skill across LME leadership.  This is where delegation/mentoring can really pay off, if one can temporarily hand off more responsibilities to focus on things that need a quick turnaround.",,,Michael Riley,mriley@argo.ai,Dan Fitzpatrick,dfitzpatrick@argo.ai,Software,

The first round of William's traffic light tool was perhaps an example; despite my cautions that this was a problem that SAIPS had just spent several months working on, with a lot of subtleties, we went from concept to use in production in an incredibly short time, with very limited validation. There have been several rounds of problems and subsequent hardening needed. It may be that it's just that a different risk profile is needed for front-end work, which absolutely requires rapid iteration and frequent contact with the users, versus pipeline / data-centric work where problems tend to be discovered remotely in both space and time.",,,Seth Porter,symmetry@argo.ai,Dan Fitzpatrick,dfitzpatrick@argo.ai,Software,

Do you feel this person is ready for promotion? ,manager,,,,Tyler Krampe,krampe@argo.ai,Dan Fitzpatrick,dfitzpatrick@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"When looking back on the past six months at Argo.ai I think I am performing at a high enough level to be promoted from a Vehicle Operator 1 (Level 3) to a Vehicle Operator 2 (Level 4). When looking at what is listed for each job level on go/levels I was honest with myself to see where I am at and what I need to work on going forward to always be improving my skills and knowledge here. I believe that the following reasons will give enough information regarding my impact within our department of Vehicle Operations. 

Knowledge & Technical Skill:

I am able to quickly and efficiently prioritize VTR's as they come in by gauging resources, weather conditions, and need for each request to be completed. I work one on one with engineers on what specifics they need to make sure the test is handled the proper way according to our guidelines of track testing and public road testing.

I have almost full domain knowledge across our fleet operations. I can handle ingest, it's not a focus of mine, but since we have been low on bricks lately and Ryan has moved to a night shift, I have been pushing bricks in and out during the day to make sure we have enough available for our daily operations.  I can teach and answer questions on all of our safety program. I have lead role playing scenarios with the large group of VO's. I use my background in improv to come up with new scenarios on the spot and to keep it fresh. I also handle a majority of our tier 2 troubleshooting. 

I lead our team of VO's by towing the line of friendly while maintaining professionalism. I have learned about their lives outside of work and can strike up a conversation with any of them. I feel I learn everyone's names very quickly, which helps them know they are important to me. I earn respect by treating everyone the same and fairly, I strive to always lead and motivate from my attitude. Even when things behind the curtain are crazy and out of control, I always lead with confidence and never let that stress show. I set the tone for the day, and push to get the most our of our VO's as well as my peers. I come in early to make sure the schedule is ready to go so our cars are running before the classroom meeting. I lead our daily mission meeting to ensure everyone has the most up to date information and answer any questions that come about from our ever changing daily procedures.  This helps the team eliminate mis-information and minimize on errors from miscommunication. 

I am constantly juggling tasks. If I am not multitasking and managing my time, parts of the operation would be too slow. Time is money here, and I understand that. At any given time I can be inputing data in our Mission tracker to have a log of cars, bricks, mileage, missions, and tests being run. This is while troubleshooting with a number of cars, keeping an eye on VTR's and securing any extra details needed for them. I will also be talking with hardware, fleet services, and test ops for their needs and keeping up with two slack workspaces. I do all of this with minimal supervision from Brandon. 

I make sure I do as I say by completing Fleetio check's on any car I am in for tests, tracking mileage and bricks and following all safety guidelines we have set in place in the depot and out on the road. I make sure that if we get a new engineer in the depot, that I am showing them proper startup and shutdown procedure. This makes sure we don't have errors like depleting the hybrid battery, which was a learning experience early on. 

My goal is to complete tasks, quickly, efficiently and most important, safely. When we get a VTR, I check with whomever put the VTR in to make sure I have all the details of what is needed. I then meet with my crew that will be executing the VTR and see what questions they have so I can be certain that the details are not missed. I will remind them through slack of the details, share any pictures that might be pertinent to their mission, and then track their progress. Once it is complete, I make sure the download log gets slacked to them as well as in the Jira ticket.

I strive to make every minute matter. I stay focused and try to drive results. I am not able to always put in long hours in the depot, but typically find myself working from home to make sure I am ready for the next day. I want to be ahead from the start. This helps me be ready for any and all curveballs that may be headed my way. If I have a big picture already in my head, it let's me adapt quickly and make the best decision quickly and confidently. I am human and make mistakes, and I hold myself accountable for all of them, and replay the situation to make sure the same mistake doesn't happen again. The best compliment I got was from Brandon when talking with Marlon while he was up in Pittsburgh training when he said, ""You don't realize it, but Dave is already 10 steps ahead of all of us"". 

I created a ""Help desk Playbook"" document to help with dispatch and troubleshooting needs. I keep the Help Desk Playbook document updated for every release to make sure that new troubleshooting procedures are well documented so even if someone has missed time, or doesn't normally handle troubleshooting they always have knowledge of the known issues of a current release.

I lead the VO day one on boarding for 3 weeks while Brandon was in Miami. I feel like I have really mentored this group and was their go-to for everything while Brandon was away. I continue to mentor our group when questions arise, or when I see a good teaching moment. I want to share my knowledge and help others learn and grow as well. 

Organizational Impact:

I tow the line of Argo information and Aerotech information daily. I need to be aware of both sides and what they are allowed to know. This helps keep the communication that is most beneficial for both sides and focus's on delivering the outcome needed.

I created a document called ""What we do"" which is an overview of what a Vehicle Operator 1 that is focused on Shift lead / Dispatch does. I have used it for training 4 other Vehicle Operators so far. It help's them get a general outline of what day to day is like for our position, as well as link's to all of the documents that we use and should bookmark. I have then continued to train them once they finished with road certification. I recently spent a week in Miami since it was Dan and Marlon's first week down there. I was using that time to make sure they understand that the culture and work environment is a direct reflection of themselves and to show the VO's how to take pride in what they do. I also helped them to understand they need to adapt what they learned in Pittsburgh at the Depot, and adapt that to work with the Terminal down in Miami. While there, I was still keeping an eye on Pittsburgh and helping my counterparts as I can.

Recently I started focusing on our vehicle utilization now that were almost up and running like we should be.  Brandon tasked our group with staying on top of this and I started tracking car's lunch break times. I took what we learned from it, to start pushing our team to understand why this is so important. Brandon and Tony have actually shared some mileage info around break times in the morning meeting's to help further push the same message to everyone. I created a ""Ride along"" and ""Depot"" visit calendar to track trips for Argo employees as well as insight into any recruiters activity to show the depot to candidates. I also added a slackbot that will help me schedule the rides for Argo employees as well as send them calendar invites and information as needed for said rides. 

Communication:

I have authored a few fleet specific documents. One being our Argo AI Fleet Grounding Report Template. This is a document I worked on with Tony to make sure we combined two existing documents to be used anytime our fleet is grounded, we have a step by step report of the details.

I have adapted and expanded the Mission Tracker. This was something Nuk created originally and we have worked together to adapt it to our growing needs. After speaking with Jacob Larry in Dearborn, I modified the form to add the fields that Dearborn and Miami required. I log all information for hardware issues we see on the vehicles for Rob V. Here is some feedback from Rob Vaniglia, ""Dave has been a pleasure to work with. His attitude and professionalism are an inspiration to myself and the rest of the Team. He always maintains his composure regardless of the chaos or changes that may come up. He has been a critical path for me when trying to assess and debug issues from the fleet. I am always coming to him with requests to gather data or things to try to help me debug. He always has the same answer “absolutely, anything I can do to help!” It is this kind of support, attitude, and Teamwork that we need to continue improving our system every day.""

I work with the other areas of our department, asking questions to understand everyone's roles, priorities and needs. This includes Fleet operations, Hardware and testing. This is done to improve my own knowledge, but it  also educates them with my own. Were a team here and the more we understand the big picture, the better we will all be. I regularly communicate with our mapping and labeling team and engineers with VTR's to understand what they need from us and how we can continuously be improving. 

Teamwork and Leadership:

I take notes of the VO's feedback and push it to my manager to get information as needed. Whenever I have ideas about how to fix any issues or to improve a current process, I use my 1:1 with Brandon to address these and work on ways to keep improving and keep learning. 

Since we have been in Miami, I started tracking their vehicles and helping them with troubleshooting as well - so remote helping an area, while doing all of my Pittsburgh responsibilities.

I feel the above shows not only how I have been exceeding with strong results as a Vehicle Operator 1, but how I can impact and grow within Argo as a Vehicle Operator 2. ",,,David Hart,dhart@argo.ai,David Hart,dhart@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"David provides a stable base for the fleet operation service within Vehicle Operations.  He successfully manages the distribution of two dozen vehicles across several domain areas.  His work ensures that development, training, testing and road operations teams have working vehicles on time and based on requests through the Jira ticketing system.  He also provides support to driver teams through morning briefings and first line triage of vehicle related problems.  

David executes his shift supervisor role with effortless precision.  He deciphers the sometimes cryptic vehicle request tickets, coordinates with requestors across the organization and ensures the vehicle assets are available and of the correct configuration for the task.   He greets users with a cheerful demeanor and quietly executes his duties with patience and poise.   During a stressful and chaotic road accident, David calmly orchestrated the initial response; calling for emergency support, the towing company and alerting senior staff of the incident and recalling all other vehicles operating in the area.  His quick action resulted in an improved organization response and helped support communication efforts across the company.  

Additionally, I witnessed David lead a team building exercise with a group of contract operators when unexpected vehicle downtime would have left them with little to do.  His quick thinking and imaginative use of that downtime contributes to the overall morale of the contract force.  Dave upholds the standards set by top management and delivers an enriched experience to the drivers he serves.  He makes those operators feel important which leads to better job performance.  His efforts pay huge dividends to the company as a whole since the vehicle operators provide valuable information back to the development teams on  a daily basis.  

Dave seeks out ways to improve the overall process within the depot and works to coordinate changes across the organization.   He helps to export process improvements to the Dearborn operation and now works to make the Miami terminal operate in the same efficient manner.  Dave's work with the ""ride-along"" calendars and his continuing efforts to improve the Mission Tracker are two examples of his process improvement mindset.  

Dave is an asset to the organization and his calm, cheerful manner promotes an excellent experience for staff, visitors and guests.   ",,,Michael Pacilio,mpacilio@argo.ai,David Hart,dhart@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Dave was a welcoming team member when I arrived who was incredibly supportive as I transitioned into my role.  He was patient with me in answering all of my questions on our process and was thoughtful in introducing me to vehicle operators.  I work with Dave on a day-to-day basis supporting the fleet to get out the door, and Dave does a great job triaging issues to me.  He is also thoughtful in giving context to issues that can be resolved by vehicle operators.  When there are new bugs and ways to resolve them Dave helps articulate a way to communicate to drivers.  Dave also helps me understand changes to Argonaut so I can better understand problems reported by vehicle operators.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"I greatly respect and admire the amount of organizing, prioritizing, and multitasking that you are able to accomplish on a daily basis.  I think that you do a great job of balancing not only all of your tasks at work effectively, but you also make it a point to try to maintain somewhat of a work/life balance as well.  Your drive and determination to get the job done and make the most of your time means that you aren't sitting at your desk staring at a screen at 6pm for no reason other than to be the last one there, and I think we could all take a page out of your book on that one, myself especially.  

From what I have seen, communication is one of your great strengths.  You have become the go-to guy for 1:1 test requests from developers, a myriad of different requests and questions from VOs, and in general, someone that everyone can count on.  When you say that something will get handled, there's no question that it will be done, and that's due to your focus on clear communication.  I have been guilty at times of not communicating personnel and resource needs frequently enough, but I appreciate the fact that you reach out when you're not sure and seek clarification so that we succeed as a team, and that has helped me out quite a few times recently.  I think that this clarity in communication transfers over very well in your messaging to VOs in briefings - you focus on the main point and don't send mixed messages that could cause confusion among others.  I also think that you do a great job of asking for the same clarity that you give if you aren't receiving it, whether from our operators, peers, or leaders - again, to keep everyone on the same page and consistent.

I think that you have struck a great balance with your team in being both friendly and stern when necessary to get the job done properly, and this is a difficult line to walk as a leader.  You aren't afraid to call someone out for doing the wrong thing, but you also aren't actively searching for that opportunity just for the sake of doing it, instead using it as a teaching moment for what should be done in the future.  With your recent focus on cleaning up utilization and unnecessary downtime, this is a very useful trait and will be met with respect due to your tactful delivery.",,,Steven Swartz,sswartz@argo.ai,David Hart,dhart@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Dave has been great.  He's very good at re-organizing things at the drop of a dime - which is a crucial part of shift leading.  Working with Dave as closely as I do, I have seen this first hand.  It didn't take long for Dave and I to work well together, as he is very easy to work with.

I initially created the Mission Tracker, but since Dave has come on board, he has helped me to expand it's resourcefulness by adding more fields of interest to the tracker such as the our other cities, Summary, Auto Miles, and various conditional formatting formulas as well.  As we have expanded our operator pool, conditional formatting has become a ""must"" in order to avoid duplicating names on the schedule for the day. (This can cause more confusion - and when one of our priorities is being efficient, it's crucial to minimize the miscommunication and/or confusion.) . Dave has also created several documents to help us track break times, troubleshoot, and handle incident response.

Dave is also our Ridealong Manager.  He created a slackbot and google calendar in order to manage the Depot Visits and Ridealongs that can be sent our way for new hires, engineers, Ford execs, etc.  This is super important that this process works well.  People wanting a ride must be able to plan around their workday.  This is hard to do if you didn't have schedule of the time slots and the respective employees associated with each.

He is a great leader for our Operators.  Dave has previous managerial experience, and from my standpoint - it definitely shines through.  He executes the second morning briefs on most occasions, and does so with great enthusiasm.  This really helps to start the day off in a positive way.  It motivates our operators even further so that we are able to maximize their output.  He's great at asking questions as well as answering them.  If he doesn't know the answer - he won't make something up, but he **will** track down the correct answer to a question he doesn't have the answer to.

Dave and I helped to train Dan and Marlon (first two Miami VO I's) over the course of their 6 weeks in Pittsburgh.  Dave also spent their first week in Miami with them to assist with any questions they might have or issues they might possibly run into.  He was awesome as expected, and also provided them with feedback of areas that are their strengths, as well as areas of improvement he'd like to see them make changes.

Dave is kind of like a sponge.  He will continuously ask questions to understand and clarify things that aren't as clear as he'd like them to be - or things that may be somewhat vague in nature.  He absorbs that information so he can distribute as necessary.  He doesn't beat around the bush and cuts right to the chase.  I love that he's a straight shooter in that way because - again - this is another way to help minimize poor communication.  If something changes, Dave wants to know why.  Not just for him - but for our operators as well.  He doesn't just want to relay _what_ the change might be, but he also wants to provide context as to _why_ it's necessary and where we are adding value by making said change(s).

Dave has been a big reason of why we're able to maintain the culture we do (as has the rest of the team).  He's a real tone setter, and gets the big picture of what we're trying to achieve. ",,,Anuruk Buranathanit,aburanathanit@argo.ai,David Hart,dhart@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"I want to grow and improve on focusing on relaying safety information to the fleet. Recently we were having a bunch of issues with the rain, and I was acknowledging these and documenting them in our proper channels, but I didn't share them with the whole fleet. Brandon had to do that, I felt and still feel bad that I didn't take the initiative on that. Sometimes I get so focused in on our precess for documentation, that I am also not thinking of our number 1 responsibility. Having a safe and informed fleet of vehicle operators. I really took that to heart, and have been more focused on improving that. 

I am always looking to know more about the platform itself. Since I started here I have learned a bunch about the linux system and base level troubleshooting. I can always be better. I always expect more from myself, and try to ask as many questions as I can to keep learning.

I also believe that improved understanding of the autonomy systems will aid in Dave's ability to provide better feedback to operators in the filed.

This will allow you to stay current on issues and processes and also to see any potential deficiencies in those processes a lot easier, leading to potentially greater efficiency on our part as a group.

Try to think about ways to improve the troubleshooting process from the lead perspective, whether by better organization, reporting method, or VO action.  I feel that the current process is something that we've all expected someone else to take full ownership of, but we can also be better at adapting to our current situation to limit the morning chaos that happens when 25 different cars troubleshoot in 25 different channels with a very limited amount of support.

She has been available to the team at all times: she has guided us in deploying new services and systems and fixing glitches.",,,Yves Dzialowski,yves@argo.ai,Deepika Soma,dsoma@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Deepika was a great help during the Argo network integration.  When new power was required for the server room she arranged to have it installed, coordinated with the electrician, and sent updates throughout the process.  During the actual integration, she was available to assist during the entire maintenance period (including off-hours).  She was able to quickly answer any questions I had about the existing environment, which made setting up the new equipment much less difficult.

Getting the new network stood up and users and machines moved to it was part of our OKRs, and Deepika helped up meet this objective by scheduling users/machines to move and facilitating the move from the NJ side.  She has also been building many new machines and immediately joining them to the new network.

Deepika helped get the ITAR machines segmented from the main PLI network by identifying machines that contain ITAR data and users that need to access it, as well as what internal resources those machines and users need access to.  We were able to get the machines segregated and physically secured in an efficient manner.

Deepika stayed late on very short notice to help get the wireless network cutover to the new Argo infrastructure, which included configuring and testing the Zoom equipment.

Deepika has come up to speed quickly on the Argo infrastructure, from network to new OSes (macOS and Ubuntu) and software/licensing.  She can troubleshoot and resolve many Zoom issues.  

Deepika has been instrumental in getting the legacy PLI network converted to Argo standards.  Her intimate knowledge of the Argo Lidar infrastructure and users needs helped in planning and executing the cutover.  Deepika is always willing to do whatever it takes to complete a project, be it making herself available for off-hours support, doing the legwork to collect necessary data, or performing research on a topic when necessary.  One of the nice things about working with Deepika on a project is that you only have to ask once for something and you can count on it getting completed.  You know when working with her that you don't have to waste cycles checking in, sending reminders, etc.  I really can't stress enough her willingness to assist in any capacity.",,,Joshua Stonemark,jstonemark@argo.ai,Deepika Soma,dsoma@argo.ai,General & Administrative,

She was also responsible for the bring-up of all new zoom rooms.
Deepika provides daily local IT support that is critical to keeping the operation running smoothly.  For me and my group, it is typically network based (floating) software licensing access issues as well as setting up and maintenance of licenses and Linux OS support.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Deepika has had a unique experience since starting at Argo.  Deepika has had to straddle the fence with her work, Argo vs PLI.  With PLI continuing to provide support and complete existing contracts, Deepika has had to manage both environments which can be difficult when one of them is so new and so fast paced such as Argo and the other handles controlled data like PLI!  Deepika has done a great job juggling both!

Deepika has come up to speed with the processes and procedures for Argo IT.  She jumped right in and worked with the team to understand how Argo IT functioned.  She met with me and Becky McKeever very early on and she was excited and ready to get started at Argo.  In the past, she was the lone provider for all users at PLI.  Now she was going to have a group of support folks to help her provide top notch services to her customers.  Some folks would have a hard time reaching out when they were the lone ranger for so long, but Deepika did a great job working with the team and reaching out for assistance.  

There were many processes and procedures that Deepika needed to come up to speed on and she did.  She was able to quickly come up to speed on our build process, which was a good thing, since 38 machines showed up at her doorstep and needed to be built.  Deepika built all of the machines and worked with the users to make sure that they understood that they should never use PLI hardware to perform Argo work and vice versa.  

Eventually, we stood up an Argo network in the New Jersey office but we had to leave the PLI network up and running as well.  This is just one example of the double work that Deepika has had to do over the last 8 months.  She has had to support two different sets of hardware, two different networks, and two different businesses.  Deepika has done a FANTASTIC job!  

Argo has also brought in many new technologies into the PLI world.  One example is Zoom for video conferencing, which they found is the backbone of the Argo business model with diverse work sites.  Deepika jumped right in from day one and helped Becky to set up the first three zoom rooms in New Jersey.  She then went on and set up 4 more.  Deepika is a very quick learner and picks up new technology very quickly!

Deepika also provided front line support for the transition of security from PLI to Argo standards.  Deepika is able to work very closely with vendors and has a great rapport with them throughout the work.  She also worked closely with the fiber provider and the internet provider!

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"As I am transitioning to a deeper role, many of the following accomplishments are still works-in-in-progress. I'm hoping they will solidify the next review cycle.

I have been involved in planning of the perception pipeline, both for ""V0"" (the initial integrated pipeline), and more definitively, planning the proposed pipeline for Q2 and beyond (focusing specifically on what the pipeline will look like for the Miami experience).  Specific examples of the former include an architecture for late fusion, as well as on-demand and multiresolution architectures for real-time recognition. One significant point of departure from existing pipeline was the emphasis on data-drive Lidar processing. This required a novel effort for annotation of Lidar data, which is still being fine-tuned. Much of this planning work involved close collaboration and discussion with Ersin.

I have begun to work with Tyler to develop a quality-insurance tool that we hope will provide a dramatic change to the labeling procotol. Instead of labeling ""from scratch"", annotators need only correct mistakes in the output of other methods. This has the added benefit of providing validation to existing automated algorithms. This is still in the planning phases, but represents one of the directions that I am most excited about.

Together with Simon, James, Erin, and Peter, I have formulated a plan for a  KITTI++ dataset. Our analysis has pointed out strategic areas of focus (such as map-building and prediction), and we worked with Brett to produce a viable plan of action. 

Together with Peter and Ersin, I have helped formalize metrics for tracking and detection.

In addition to that, I have been active in outreach and recruitment, and believe that I have contributed to bringing in some high-performing recent hires. I have also collaborated with Jeremy in reaching out to a large number of potential hires for localization and maps.

Finally, I have learned a considerable amount (and am continuing to learn more!) about the various on-car systems, including tracking and prediction, as well as hardware configurations (particularly in the context of planning Z2). These have helped me obtain a clearer picture of the entire AV stack, and the role of perception within it.

Finally, I believe that I am generally responsive and available, both to peers and my direct reports, both in email and slack. I have regularly interacted with downstream team members (Josh, Jingyan, Chao, Lakshmi, Kyoung Min) and provided feedback.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"     It's been over six months since Princeton Lightwave, including myself became part of Argo; And this past six months, I have witnessed and experienced a lot of changes.  I have seen people being let go, and I've also seen new faces joining Argo. 
      As part of the production line that's being phased out,  I was one of the few left to continue and finish some of the PLI legacy product that still needed to be ship.  With my acting supervisor (Joe Poekert), Joe and I managed to ship the SLD's. I am proud  to say that we have managed to ship it by learning the operation needed to finish it.  I learned how to pull test the butterfly package and learned to work with the capping/seam sealer.  I also built and shipped the last buy order of the TO-56's and PLA-641.  There were 300 units of SPADS shipped as well.  Aside from finishing up the PLI Legacy product,  I have also trained a few of Engineers and Technician from Ball Aerospace and Gooch & Housego.   These are the companies that acquired PLI's Legacy product line.  I showed them the  steps and operations on how to build PLI's legacy product which are the SLD and the 1650 lasers.  

As with the development of the new Lidar,  I have lend my time and support to Junfu Chen in whatever assembly he needed for his TEC experiment.  I am looking forward to work with everybody to achieve a common goal which is to produce The Lidar  soon.

To  summarize this past 6 months, I can proudly say that I am open to changes.  I am easy to adapt, hard worker, and is capable of handling any challenges that comes my way.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"During this review cycle, I made contributions to the Argo software system, which include online vehicle code and offline analysis tools. While creating new features, I was keeping maintaining and improving the stability and performance of current system. Below is a list of my contributions:

New projects I have participated in:
1. Collaborated with Yi Zhang and delivered the Segmentation Benchmark tool. User could quantitively assess the segmentation result using metric scores generated by this tool. Typical use cases include segmentation evaluation and parameters tuning. I also provided a Segmentation Benchmark visualizer, which enables users to check the benchmark result frame-wise. These tools are widely used across teams especially the tracking and detection. I became the go-to person of these modules and I kept adding new features and providing supports to other teams.

2. Designed and implemented the Camera-Lidar Stream Aligner with the generic Stream Aligner created by Nick Meyer, which synchronizes the packets between the Camera and Lidar by timestamp. User could easily handle the Camera and Lidar messages through the callback function. This tool has been integrated in the tracking pipeline for the Camera-Lidar fusion. Also, I have provided a lot of supports to detection team and helped them in synchronizing Camera-Lidar data by using this tool.

3. Worked on GPU pipeline and designed the GPU operation node interface. Collaborated with Evgeny Televitckiy and utilized the new GPU memory manager. With this interface, users are able to instantiate and manage the GPU node by taking the benefit of the polymorphism. 
Delivered GPU pipeline V2 prototype, which takes benefits of the new GPU shared memory management and new GPU abstracted Node. This is really a big project, and I have demonstrated the ability to design and implement new modules on my own. I kept communicating with my teammates and improving my works based on their feedbacks. All modules are well tested to ensure they could be well integrated into our system. All of these are motivated by my eagerness to impact and improve the current system. 

4. Worked with Yi Zhang and created the ground hole filling tool. This tool fills the ground potholes using the ground height from the neighbors. It reduces the risk of invalid ground height query, which was caused by the ground data not effectively collected.

5. Enhanced the Mapping team Ground surface extraction tool and implemented the ground visualization tool. These tools made it easier for users to visualize the ground information and debug ground map height related code. Supported Robert Keelan and Yi Zhang to deliver the ground removal using the ground map.

6. Contributed to the ADAF and created the Tracking latency plotting tool. This tool provides the python accessibility to the diagnostic signals and intuitive latency plot of each module in the Lidar pipeline. 

Existing projects I continued making improvements on:
1. Refactored the segmentation with 3D Binary Grid method using the ND-Grid. The 3D Binary Grid method increases the detection range of small objects such as barrels up to 70m while holding a low false positive rate. 

2. Refactored the ROI with non-moving partitions and faster polygons intersecting method. This results in up to 10x performance improvement. The significant improvement partially solved the slow tracking pipeline issue during the code red.

3. Kept maintaining the visualization tool. I simplified the usage of point clouds by adding more features to the PointCloudModel and creating the PointCloudManager. These enable users to handily create, update and draw the point clouds in the plugins. Additionally, I have made the ground height in tracking plugins adjustable and resolved the point cloud and convex hull alignment issue. 

 I have focused on improving not only my software skills, but also the willingness and ability to communicate and collaborate with team members. I felt much more confident in leading small projects and making presentation in front of my teammates. 
 Also, I was eager to keep contributing ideas among my team and across other teams, including Mapping, Visualization, Tracking and Localization teams. 

 Besides, I was able to take ownership and initiative when assigned to challenging tasks such as the Lidar and Camera pipelines projects mentioned above. During the work, I insisted taking responsibility of productivity as well as quality control. I well tested every module especially the on-vehicle code I created. 
I worked closely with the integration team to ensure my contribution could work as intended. Through these tasks, I gained the domain knowledge regarding presenting and processing data such that they could be effectively available to our consumers. 

Therefore, I am confident that my work experiences and improvements would enable me to move forward and fill the requirements in the next level.",,,Dongran Liu,dliu@argo.ai,Dongran Liu,dliu@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Last feedback cycle the two main areas of improvement were communication and code quality.

After the feedback it was clear a conscious effort was made to improve on both of these areas. Code quality and level of testing of PRs improved significantly. Additionally, the speed of the PRs didn't suffer dramatically which is great. Additionally, the quality of communication was greatly improved. This was shown in the stream aligner project. The aligner was created by a different team and Dongran stepped up and implemented a new version of the aligner and made it clear to the other team what his plans and timelines were.

During code red, he put in a lot of work debugging and benchmarking the tracker.

Worked with Yi to implement the ground hole filling algorithm. He created tools here to help visualize and work with ground data.

Helped refactor the ROI and ground removal code.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Dongran and I have been working closely during this cycle on many projects. Overall, I enjoy working with him not just because of his solid software engineering skills, but also the fast growing domain knowledge in perception and responsive communication. All of these aspects have contributed to an overall impressive productivity.

We have been working closely on many projects. To name a few, Dongran is the owner of point cloud segmentation benchmark visualization. We did not have any quantitative measurements to our segmentation module---a critical part of the perception pipeline---until early this year. Dongran has been actively involved in metric designing, and later he has designed and implemented the visualization submodule in a timely manner. And it provides intuitive quality assessment to our fundamental perception algorithms. 

We have also been working closely on camera-LiDAR synchronization---a crucial module that gives better sensor synchronization with software. Dongran takes on camera-LiDAR stream aligner that takes calibrated camera/LiDAR parameters and gives straightforward interface to have better synchronized messages.

Dongran has also been supporting on ground removal with rasterized height map. He has designed a visualization tool that gives simple and intuitive assessment to our height map quality. This tool has also been extremely helpful for debugging the ground removal library. Later, we worked together on a library that ""fills"" missing data in the height map. After a 30min quick sync meeting, Dongran was able to deliver the ""hole finder"" counterpart within 24 hours.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Since coming on I have taken over all radar activities in both support of not only currently in service fleet but also set a roadmap for future radar sensors and relevant technologies.

For the existing fleet I have:
- Collaborated with perception infrastructure, vehicular infrastructure and vehicle team to debug the Z0 radar suite and advise on the radar data flow to ensure proper ingestion of radar data
- Mentored and collaborated with the radar signal processing group to help them understand sensor specific performance issues, sensor specific data structures, and architecture dependent performance issues

For the current in build fleet I have:
- In the absence of low level supports, I have stepped into the role of writing scripts to log bench and vehicle radar data for sensors characterization and debug.
- Architecture and design a radar centric vehicular platform for data logging and radar sensors characterization 
- Establish a method for characterization the impact of high data rates over the CAN networks
- Worked with Ford to help them navigate the process of integrating radar behind secondary surfaces and guide them on integrating radar for non-forward looking
- Worked with Aptiv make sure the characterization of the secondary surfaces are done properly

For Z2 planned build I have:
- Moved us to a different vendor that aligns well with our radar strategy and roadmap
- Moved us to a sensor architecture that will provide higher fidelity data to improve our ability to ingest radar data such as higher number of points for data association (associating to tracks or associating to LIDAR point cloud)
- Work with the system team to help them understand the role of radar and help them make sense of radar coverage and to help determine the optimum number of radar sensors that will balance out between sensing coverage and integration complexities.

For future platform and sensors:
- I have performed a market study to ensure Argo understands all the radar players in this field which includes startup, TIER 1s, Tier 2s and design houses.
- I established Argo as an organization that understands radar, radar design, and the sensitivity of radar technologies.  I do this through communicating concisely with potential vendors and through the release of Argo’s radar requirements.  This interaction helps communicates to vendors that we at Argo knows what we want from a radar sensors and what is technically and physically attainable in this space.  This reduces wasteful interactions with vendors that are pursuing esoteric approaches that are not producible and does not have relevant performance gain in automotive radar.
- Above interactions have attracted those from NXP and Astyx who are keen to support those that can help bring radar technologies quicker to market.
- I emphasize simplicity in radar design to ensure architectures are manufacturable.  This helps Argo find alternatives in radar partners in the likelihood that a preferred radar supplier is no longer accessible.  This is seen through my emphasis on low complexity MIMO arrays, and fast chirp approach, rather than PMCW and active phased arrays such as meta materials LC networks and lenses.
- I keep abreast of works coming out from the European Microwave community as these are the sources of RF and mm-wave innovations.  This is done through weekly review of conferences and journals from these communities.",,,Duc Vu,dvu@argo.ai,Duc Vu,dvu@argo.ai,Hardware,

He is a creative problem solver, which is critical since much of the work for Z1 and beyond is new territory

Dustin is always open to input from me and other team members and is primarily concerned with delivering the best VDS to the customer. 

He has a “get it done” attitude and can be counted on to deliver to his commitments.
He pulls the team together, and drives the effort to resolve issues as they crop up.  He also works to predict what issues may develop for future designs.  

Dustin is comfortable working in an environment where he needs to develop the methods and process needed to deliver on his OKRs.  His work in developing a method to link camera bench results to VDS detection clearly demonstrates this trait.   This workstream also demonstrated his persistence in solving complicated technical challenges.  While the testing is not complete, there is every reason to believe that if the results don’t pan out, he will learn from them and pivot quickly to another method that is promising.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Dustin has been, on frequent occasion, put into tough political situations over the most recent review cycle, and has done exceedingly well at managing them given the challenge they present.  Of course, I'm speaking here of work on cooling and thermal analysis with Velodyne, Autoliv/Veoneer, and Venky's team at Ford.  This was always going to be fraught with frustration and flared tempers.  Dustin's cool and calm demeanor and dedication to dispassionate analysis was perfect for this endeavor.  Though progress at Ford, Velodyne, and Veoneer has been frustratingly slow, I do think that we're on a path to doing all that is reasonable to improve our outlook for thermals with the VLS-128i's, and the fact that we've gotten there without a major meltdown is a credit to Dustin's patience and ability to keep things moving.

Dustin has also taken on cleaning, which, after some attempts at Ford, I've found to be a surprisingly challenging issue to address. Again, this requires significant work with multiple constituencies at Ford, and Dustin has done well to progress this effort and keep all parties on the same page and working smoothly together. I'm not as up to date as I should be on progress and results in this area, but in the work I've done with him on this I've appreciated his diligence and patience with the topic.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"My greatest strengths are probably my breadth of knowledge and passion for solving challenging problems. In my last job I was designing, testing, and troubleshooting components for automated industrial vehicles. When I started at Argo I was able to bring use that experience to help make the Z1 tiara design successful. Since the last review I have transitioned by focus to the cooling and cleaning systems, systems that I have had less experience in, but have been excited to take on!

The cooling and cleaning systems are new in the Z1 design and need to be built from the ground up. Some of my accomplishments in this area have been:
- Cooling - I have become the point of contact in the VLS-128i cooling discussions at the request of Ford (Ahmad) and Velodyne (David) as a result of my ability to keep everyone driving tin a consistent and meaningful direction, particular on the action items and test plans.
- Cooling - I have researched  and advised direction on the TEC and solar shade methods of cooling the VLS-128i, including the ultimate decision to exclude the TEC from the build in favor of pursuing a solar shade solution
- Cooling - I have done temperature analyses to determine min/max ambient conditions, solar intensities, and worked with Ken Jackson to analyze localized thermal conditions on the vehicle exterior in order to accurately identify the thermal conditions under which the sensors are performing
- Cooling/Cleaning - Working closely with Ken Jackson and Sri Damaraju to develop a strong framework for the specing of the cooling and cleaning requirements for Z2.
- Cleaning - I've worked with closely both Argo and Ford sensor owners in order to develop test plans to assess the cleaning performance of the Z1 system and beyond. I've also been working with both Ken Jackson and Niv Chandrasekaran to identify scenarios in which the cleaning performance may impact system performance.",,,Dustin Yautz,dyautz@argo.ai,Dustin Yautz,dyautz@argo.ai,Hardware,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Dustin's passion and strong work ethic are evident in all tasks he takes on.  He brought his experience and analytical skills to the Z1 design to help successfully meet the design release.  He is an effective communicator and always very happy to support in all areas.  He has provide a great deal of insight to the Z1 design and helped push for the areas of opportunity we identified within the Z1 design.  

Dustin has taken ownership of the cooling and cleaning systems and made significant strides towards defining how these systems need to be defined. The framework for future specs is much better laid out and should help lead towards effective collaboration with Ford.  This work also contributes to us better characterizing performance of the Z1 system.

For the lidar cooling, he has explored a number of options for improvement and pushed for testing and analysis leading to a solar shade plan that shows significant improvement and will allow for operation at higher ambient temperatures.

I have been working with Ken Jackson to better understand the SOPs, expectations, culture, and structure of this powerful organizational machine. In the past, the only information that I had received was second-hand, through PMT1, but now that I have a better understanding of each of the roles of not only the PMT groups, but also TSE and testing, I can reach out to each of them directly while keeping PMT1 in the loop.

I am also continuously learning more about different thermal tools, products, and effects, leaning on Ken Jackson's experience in Automotive and Sri Damaraju's electronics experience. I am working to learn more about typical air cooled and liquid cooled systems, both standard automotive and non-standard cases.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Before joining Argo, I had limited experience in C++11 and no experience with C++14 or C++17. I feel that I have very quickly picked up the new language features and integrated them into my everyday code.

Since I joined Argo 4 months ago, I have become familiar with the MotionPlanning code base to the point that I am now leading the task-level design and implementation of the Trajectory Generator, the largest part of our code base.

During code red, I advocated for thoughtful fixes that made our code more reliable, rather than just checking the boxes to make things work. MotionPlanning's attention to detail in this regard was praised by senior engineers on other teams.

I have contributed numerous small fixes to the build system and core libraries, including adding compile-time linking to plugins and removing the need for sudo to use Incredibuild.

I took on the task of implementing the ExtensibleTrajectory based on Neal's design docs. This turned out to be a massive undertaking, involving a lot of templates. I am pleased with the result, which has become a key part of our software.

I am considered a ""go-to"" person by others on the team for C++ code features and writing efficient, quality code. I recently was accepted as a reader for C++ and a code-owner for MotionPlanning.",,,Ed Venator,evenator@argo.ai,Ed Venator,evenator@argo.ai,Software,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Ed has played a significant role in our codebase even though he just recently joined. He makes frequent recommendations in making our code more efficient, consistent, and ensures we follow our coding standard. He often makes suggestions to bring us up to speed with best practices for C++17. Aside from developing code for the MP stack, he also contributes core libraries and infrastructure improvements. He is regarded as an excellent resource for discussing and determining the best approach to C++ implementations.

Ed's first major contribution was with the ExtensibleTrajectory. This was a much needed object that is used through most of the MP stack with most libraries using it to some capacity.  It is efficient and flexible to meet all of our needs, and it's been suggested that it may be used in the Motion Control stack as well.  

Ed's current major contribution is the refactor of the TrajectoryGenerator and all of the major libraries to prepare it for parallelization.  He took ownership of the design and implementation of it and held a design review to discuss topics that involve engineering decisions. He is currently doing the refactor and reorganization of code to better support parallelization.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Ed got up to speed on the motion planning team faster than anyone, and he has already made major contributions. 

Since his first week at Argo he has reviewed nearly every motionplanning PR. He questions our coding practices and when appropriate advocates for better ones, particularly in the areas of directory structure, namespacing, error handling, etc. Ed was approved as a C++ reader and motionplanning code owner faster than anyone else on the team.
Ed has contributed to the codebase outside of motionplanning. One example is a script he wrote to check that .json config files match the .asl files.

He successfully used VTune to profile our TrajectoryGenerator task and identify efficiency bottlenecks where we should focus our efforts. On his own initiative, he designed a total refactor of the TrajectoryGenerator task to improve maintainability (by moving code from the task to tested modules) and to support parallelization. Over the last several weeks he’s been executing his design without disruption to the rest of the team.

I also worked closely with Ed on the ExtensibleTrajectory data structure. ExtensibleTrajectory supports efficient interpolation by distance and time, and is templated for extensibility to Motion Planning, Motion Control, and Prediction.  Ed provided feedback on my design doc iterations. When I turned over the design to him he implemented it quickly and without any issues. Where the design doc didn’t explicitly spell out how something should be implemented, he implemented it just as I had envisioned or better. ",,,Neal Seegmiller,nseegmiller@argo.ai,Ed Venator,evenator@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Ed joined Argo in January and in quickly became an integral member of the motion planning team. His first task was implementing the Prediction plugin and widget, which has been useful in visualization and debugging. Next, he implemented ExtensibleTrajectory, PlanningTrajectory, associated interpolation libraries from Neal’s design. These were very thoroughly implemented and templated in order to make the code very generalizable. We have been using this class throughout our code ever since. During code-red he made significant contributions towards improving our error handling. He also spent on day all the kickouts on a set of logs with myself and Neal. 

In the lead-up to the demo, Ed was involved in preparing the code for lane changes. Afterward, he designed and and is just wrapping up implementation of a refactor of TrajectoryGeneratorTask. This is moving us towards better errorhandling, parallelization, and making the code more testable and maintainable. I believe it is a very well thought-out design and implementation. Especially in this effort, he was very good about planning out the implementation and scoping tickets appropriately. In addition, his presentation of the design in a design review was very effective.

Ed’s code is generally very clean and requires few changes in the review stage. This is in part because of how well he splits his implementation into manageable PRs that are easy to review. On the MP team, Ed has also distinguished himself through his understanding of the C++ language and code features.

Ed very quickly started reviewing a lot of PRs. He started by just making formatting requests. However, these were formatting things that others on the team were not follow, so his requests were important for making our overall coding style better. After he became more comfortable with the codebase, his reviews expanded to include comments relating to the approach outside of just the coding style. Since joining, Ed has been the most prolific code reviewer on the MP team.

He has championed code quality, reliability, and efficiency, as well as the latest C++ best practices all while taking into account problems unique to the robotics field. Ed is the rare individual who can balance strong software development best practices with domain specific algorithmic problem solving. Of the challenges that Ed has tackled, two of them stand out the most to me.

1. There was on ongoing need and drive for the team to change approaches in the data structures used to manage trajectories. Ed took on the challenge of implementing the very complex design of a very efficient, yet easy to use, serializable ExtensibleTrajectory templated data structure. This data structure implementation has saved countless hours in productivity for our team, achieving most if not all of the stated design objectives. Ed took a very complex project and delivered it in logical steps with extremely thorough testing, instilling a tremendous amount of confidence from the team and myself in his abilities.

2. Many areas of our MotionPlanning stack have been in need of redesign or refactoring in order to deliver newer features while maintaining or improving our cycle time constraints. Not the least of these is the TrajectoryGenerator, which is the core component of our stack. Ed has owned optimizing this task for quite a while now. It started with profiling our code and looking for strong candidates for speed-ups, and has now evolved into a complete refactor and modularization effort in order to parallelize the task. Ed scoped and created tickets for this work, and took the lead on execution. Due to Ed's understanding of parallel design principles and leadership, we are well on our way to having this task run with parallel threads.

I don't typically seek out opportunities to mentor others on the team. As we gain more new teammates, I should spend more time both mentoring new team members and documenting my knowledge for others' benefit.

I still struggle to accurately estimate story points for tasks. This was apparent over the last few sprints when the design for the Trajectory Generator re-architecture took me more than a full week, whereas I had only budgeted a couple days for it.

Ed has added questions and comments to many different design documents that the team has produced. However, it was only recently that he led the design and implementation on his own (TrajectoryGenerator task refactor).

He has been leading the supplier relationship with Veoneer on the ITM and CMS modules and Eric’s technical background has been a great asset in working through many of the development challenges with these modules. Eric also contributed to trade study and vendor meetings for both inertial sensors and RTOSs.

Eric has been a pleasure to work with so far and always has a cheerful and upbeat attitude. I know that he is someone I can go to with concerns about technical or programmatic issues and can expect thoughtful, practical responses. I appreciate his breadth of technical and program management experience; he’s been a wonderful addition to the Argo team.

Specifically, he has been leading the weekly touchpoint discussions with our Tier1 partners on CMS and ITM, but also internally has been able to help with the management and organization of the engineering groups working on those projects. He has been able to step up while I was unavailable and successfully bridge any gaps.

With Eric's help, the embedded software development effort has been able to gain a lot more structure through careful planning and management of the engineering tasks, but also by getting a lot of the different Argo stakeholder more involved with those decisions.

For the above reasons Eric has been a great addition to the Argo organization and has definitely shown significant improvement made since he joined to the different programs he manages.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,report,"Ersin has shown confident/solid leadership. 

Major Achievements:  Stabilize ML team 
a) Simplify communication routes: ML team members now receive request/feedback/question through Ersin. But, team members still can communicate with anyone without any limitation. It stops wasting their energy for responding to similar question/request/feedback. 

b) Balance between ML model development and in-vehicle software development: ML team could be excluded from in-vehicle development, because they focus mainly on model development. For avoiding this undesirable direction, Ersin has tried to make pairs between PI team members and ML team members (a.k. 'peer-buddy' ). It will improve performance of ML team and provide better understanding from PI team. 

c) Make team achievement/contribution be visible: Ersin has tried to show ML team's achievement as many as possible. It convinces members of ML team that their achievement makes a strong contribution to Argo. 

d) Clarify goals of ML team: in short period of time (one~two month), he has set up the goals of ML team. It was not just abstract, but very concrete plan which Argo should pursue. ",,,Kyoung Min Lee,klee@argo.ai,Ersin Yumer,eyumer@argo.ai,Software,

He organized brainstorming sessions that focused in on the specific problem areas for the traffic light pipeline and divided up the work for the revamped pipeline into self-contained modules. He has done a good job of listening to the team's input and ensuring that our ML work gets recognized in the face of machine learning projects having a slow turnaround time.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"I view the time I spent at Argo so far as “setting the ground for success” period. My goal has been steering and mentoring the team to stay on top of activities that will pay the bill, while always being ahead of the curve and not on the critical path so that we can build the next, state-of-the-art perception system that will contribute significantly. 

I will summarize impact and contributions during this period in four main categories: (1) the technology and (2) team I am responsible for, (3) the org and cross team collaboration, and (4) external visibility.


**(1) ML Algorithms Tech**

In Q1/18, We improved the Object detection performance by 10%: 
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OtHhCuOZ6vy9CGi8iptDLe8ViQg8btfnSXWXIF_DNhc/edit#slide=id.g36a6eed5b8_88_447 

We solved the near range detection problems with data augmentation, without using additional labeled data:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-ElrE327uhtxwe8LPLvEAudXzXpNFqmLCLsGTciiGDw/

We designed and started implementing a state-of-the-art object detection pipeline, which introduces a number of key features over the (now) legacy detection approach: sensor fusion at multiple levels, 3D detection with object orientation to assist prediction better, sensor redundancy to increase robustness, and stereo camera considerations to integrate Z2/J1 near-field sensor suit:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JS256pbxIupXjefCAiJMxZLpVlQ10oWZsznLsrA3kf4/ 

We designed and started implementing a state-of-the-art traffic lights (TL) pipeline, which introduces a number of key features over the (now) legacy TL approach: TL face detection instead of crop classification to eliminate background noise, occlusion reasoning, tracking with sensor and traffic light subset redundancy, as well as flashing light capabilities:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kb5FQi72owtPM-TVGl5X714tBkHbkXLBo2R1Ktqxzac/ 

Note that these two high level designs mark the final versions for detection and traffic lights. As such, they underpin the technology that will be contributed to the automation stack. We have an incremental plan to work our way towards these final designs while also introducing significant improvements to the on-vehicle performance as laid out by our OKRs:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cRu3o5MotSsy-IF2Uv4xpdP6jdW6hMmXQ1zP6X99ZZk/ 


**(2) ML Algorithms Team**

The team started working on the above cited new pipelines we own. More specifically, each IC has clear ownerships among many modules involved in the new designs, and as a team they work harmoniously towards what they agree is the right way to do object detection and traffic light state observation. Multiple team members explicitly cited that they believe we have the right ingredients as intermediate/long term goals, as well as immediate actionable tasks to take us there.

Note that the ML Algorithms Team has a mixture of off-board training workflow, as well as an on-board inference workflow. Off-board code and results was traditionally not tracked and there was even training code that lived in Google Drive. To improve reproducibility, and tracking the performance improvements of off-board work, I introduced an off-board code repository ( https://github.com/argoai/ml-experimental ) which serves as an intermediary repo for ICs experimental code before it is mature and worthy enough to move to the single AV repository. 

Moreover, to monitor and objectively evaluate off-board training results, we introduced an automated report generation mechanism for the technologies the team is working on ( http://detection-reports.argoai.tools/ ). This also gives visibility into the team’s work for the rest of the organization. At any time, you can point to this website and you should be able to match the options at the top-level menu to individual modules in the new designs cited above, as well as the legacy models. 

I have actively promoted, and mentored the team on, best coding practices. The team’s first two readers achieved readership during this time. 


**(3) Argo Org and Cross Team Collaboration**

- Brought the team to PIT to assist the SW org for the 29th Demo. Concretely, we helped mapping debug the TLs in the map and brought the “working” TLs in the demo map from zero to five in 3 days. 

- Continuously assisted the labeling team with consistent requests resulting from careful planning. Have explicitly received feedback from the team that they have noticed significant commitment in a sustained direction. 

- Worked actively with tracking/prediction when designing the new fused detection and segmentation interface.

- Initiated the miami internal demo plan with Peter Carr and Al Costa: 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yZfqwwvokHRIAEiHdxcGms58JzUIJnFjuom-F6v5hXs/ 

- Started an ML-PI buddy program with Guillaume Binet to prevent “throw over the wall problem” between algorithm design and low-level implementation support. 

- Worked with Mike Happold on near field stereo solution for Z2/J1. 

- Assisted the HW team on compute, sensor suite selection, cleaning system design, ml for dirt detection, and nvidia alternatives evaluation.

- Assisted the Systems team on perception stack risk mitigation, as well as systems level analysis of machine learning algorithms’ impact to AV.

- Wrote the new code review policy and put it into action with Dave Schwanky:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qep-Ccotd6rThR0SeMafmvkWsgrWIelPlyyLpDZM1-g/ 


**(4) External Visibility**

- Actively scouted Linkedin and activated 10+ potential candidates from my network, of which 5+ are scheduled for an onsite.

- Have been directly reached out by graduating students / current professionals asking to work with me at Argo. As a result, put the strongest 3 of them for interviews. One hired as an intern (from Stanford), and one is at the offer stage for a full-time position (from Princeton). 

- Published two papers with Argo AI affiliation in CVPR 2018, which is the flagship conference in computer vision / machine learning, directly helping the brand and the visibility of the company.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Ersin and I started about the same time and I have gotten to know him over the past 2.5 months as his TPM. There were four main areas that I have worked with Ersin on over this time:

1. New Task Tracking Method

Ersin has experience in agile methodologies and team implementation. That being the case, he was a great help to me and my team during the time we were developing the sprint tracker and associate process. He provided great feedback on the ""look and feel"" as well as the over all functionality. 

Roll out with Ersin's team was easy. He acted as a strong advocate of the process and projected that excitement to the team. He also worked closely with me on the roll out and implementation of Sprint Tracker.

2. Weekly Reporting

Every week Ersin and his team are responsible for producing a slide deck that summarizes the previous week's efforts and outlines the upcoming week's effort. This was an easy implementation with Ersin. As with the Sprint Tracker Ersin embraced the process and got him team excited about it also. Week to week his reviews are on time and honest. This is extremely helpful in helping to manage the effort of his team.

3. Weekly Planning

Ersin is easy to communicate with and always makes time to work with me. He is dedicated to the process and works hard to make sure that his team is working on the right items every week to ensure his team is driving to their longer team goals. I am always in ""the know"" on what his team is doing and how it is proceeding. 

4. Quarterly Planning

At the conclusion of Q1, the TPM team drove an intense two week planning session for Q2. Ersin continues to work closely with myself and stayed positive through the entire process. He also provided valuable feedback during and after the planning that we will or have incorporated into the process moving forward.

In general Ersin is a great communicator. He is respectful with his feedback and I appreciate his honesty. In this same way he, is able to project this excitement to his team and they respond in a positive manner. He is also a strong supporter of my team and the processes that we deploy/enforce. I am looking forward to continuing to work with Ersin.

- Ersin hasn't required the team to use any framework for deep learning, and he hasn't wanted the team to have to use a monolithic code base that might not work for every application.  Overall this is a good thing because it has facilitated research.  However, there are a few instances where this has slowed down the team because we've spent time implementing models in various frameworks rather than settling down on one.  An earlier decision to prefer tensorflow would have been helpful.  It might also be good to provide some concrete expectations for best practices.  For example, it may be good to set up some more explicit expectations for model re-usability, or to discuss ways to handle data so that it's easy for other people to use it as well.",,,Richard Kwant,rkwant@argo.ai,Ersin Yumer,eyumer@argo.ai,Software,

I would rotate who does this so that everyone is experiencing how things go wrong on the vehicle. Also, I would encourage the attitude of wanting to see where the Detection system breaks, and what are the patterns in this. And I would drive the improvements on the camera side. The autoexposure is a disaster at the moment, but much of the data we use or have used is not representative of this.

As a team, we implemented the full AL1 signal processing pipeline on an FPGA by January. Since then we focused our efforts on optimization and this will continue to be the main focus in the next few months.

My personal contribution on this DSP team was implementing back-end signal processing which included noise filtering and waveform analysis. Since finishing the initial implementation in January, I improved the FPGA back-end data processing to allow real-time processing.

I learned to use Xilinx Vivado and High Level Synthesis (HLS) tools since the acquisition. In the past I have mostly worked with Intel/Altera FPGA tools and had no experience with any high level synthesis tools. I have gained significant experience in Xilinx Vivado and HLS; our FPGA designs were done using these tools.

I co-authored FPGA/firmware version control procedures and guidelines, collaborating with Gennaro Salzano. I have used version control systems with firmware code in the past, following well-established guidelines. This was the first time working with a repository at a nascent stage. I have grown tremendously in my organizational skills from spearheading this effort, even though it is still a working progress.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Esther contributed significantly to the development, implementation, and optimization of embedded signal processing algorithms for the Argo Lidar system.  During this review cycle, she ported legacy algorithms from CPU code to an FPGA architecture, and focused on the most computationally heavy sections of the signal processing algorithm, including the histogram filter and waveform analysis steps.  She developed novel methods of optimizing noise tracking algorithms to improve parallelism, and is using robust Monte Carlo simulation methods to reduce bit widths to reduce resource utilization and improve speed without sacrificing data quality.  In addition to her signal processing work, she is also aiding hardware teams with embedded firmware tasks.

Esther is a fast learner, self driven, and works well independently with minimal oversight.  In the last six months, she has learned gmapd signal processing algorithms, Xilinx Vivado software tools, HLS programming, Monte carlo simulation, and the Linux operating system.  Esther is also very organized and volunteers to document valuable reference guides and meeting notes for the team.  She is an attentive listener, easy to work with, and open to discuss alternative points of view.  She maintains a positive attitude and calm demeanor in the face of difficult challenges.

edit 5/9: I modified Esther's score from 3 to 2 due to the fact that Argo performance review scores primarily indicate suggestion for promotion rather than quality of work.  However, to be clear, she exceeded my expectations throughout this review cycle, and is at least rated a score of 3 with respect to a normal 5 star scoring convention.",,,Sam Wilton,swilton@argo.ai,Esther Wei,ewei@argo.ai,Hardware,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Over this review period Esther has really hit the ground running in terms of learning of new development tool software, repository structure development, and backend DSP for the new Lidar system.

Esther has become proficient with the new Xilinx software development tools (Vivado and HLS) in a very short period of time which facilitated an early start to the real development work on the Lidar system.  Similarly, she came up to speed quickly with the Python programming language.  Esther is a self-starter who can easily and quickly learn whatever software tools are needed to complete the job.

Esther has become the go-to person for all things Git.  From initially introducing the concepts of the Git repo to the company to working refining the development of the repo structure, she has played a major role in founding and improving the source control process for software/firmware development.

On the DSP side of things, Esther has done a great job collaboratively working with Gennaro and Sam on the development of the DSP algorithms for the back-end signal processing of the Lidar system.  She has done an impressive job learning, developing, and optimizing the back-end signal processing which required a steep learning curve for the HLS software development tools.  This development work is an innovative and critical challenge for the company, a challenge that I feel that Esther has the skills and ability to meet.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"There's no highly specific area of improvement that I can think of.  My suggestions are more broad based and long-term growth focused.

In the future, in the pursuit of subject matter expertise in FPGA signal processing implementation, I recommend taking a proactive stance to learn as much as possible about the state-of-the-art methods, tools, and mathematical frameworks involved with highly optimized, embedded, statistical signal processing.  To take your role to the next level, continue to grow and develop your skills in this area by reading books and articles, viewing lectures, and continuing to experiment with new and creative ideas for R&D to lead the development of gmapd dsp algorithms and implementation.  Porting legacy developments and getting things to work (at all) is the most important pursuit of the present, but deeper level innovation will be required in the future to push the limits of what we can achieve.

I worked with our Hiring team to create job descriptions for my team openings. I reviewed 100+ applications.

I contributed to numerous discussions during Z0 design to define the Logging capability for sensor data (raw images mainly).

With people in my team and the detection team I drove the end to end delivery of the next iteration of the detection model, Argonet 3.0

I worked with Legal, IT, Procurement and the Aetros team to license Aetros (SaaS and on-premise) which is used to facilitate Traffic Light model training.

I worked with AWS and MXNet support teams to scale our SSD training to multiple nodes on AWS infrastructure (we haven't been able to reach accuracy and speedup we hoped yet).

With the Data team, I drove to completion the addition of DetectionMessage and TrackerMessage into our Parquet data for further analytics.

I drove the effort of evaluating GCP vs AWS for Log processing and ML training.

I worked with Lee Morris to define GPU budget for 2018 ML training needs.

I have little doubt that with different mentorship the process would have been different and a lot less educational.

With respect to the technical work that I've done for Etienne on PDM, he's served as my main resource as I've worked through the design and early implementation of the project I'm working on now.  Most of my prior work has been in organizations consuming the outputs of ML-based systems (vs developing them), and Etienne has done a lot to help me understand the requirements of building infrastructure for a team that's developing ML-based systems.  He also shares and explains papers and best-practices with a specific focus on our team's directive pretty regularly.

He is demanding of himself and others. As a former computer scientist, I know that sometimes technical people are impatient when it comes for setting in-person meetings and prefer to have things resolved quickl via email.    In his work, Etienne showed a keen ability to discern which scenarios can be resolved via a quick email exchange and which scenarios need a more in-depth analysis and review.    In matters of heightened complexity, such as licensing of neural networks, Etienne insisted on a personal meeting with all stakeholder to deeper understand the cross-section of legal, business and technology needs.  In those meetings, Etienne asked good questions and educated stakeholders.   Subsequently, Etienne drove the project by frequent follow-ups on the status and execution.   We successfully obtained a good neural trainer license thanks to Etienne's tact with the external vendor and Etienne's ability to bring internal legal and business teams together.

* Develop design documents to more clearly communicate design intent and evaluate the systemic impact of technical decisions. The initial refactoring of the old LiDAR pipeline made changes which introduced several issues into the deployed LiDAR pipeline, and was not accompanied by a design document. The tradeoffs considered in this work were not captured before work began, and this makes it difficult to know if the implementation meets the intended design, or if changes in capabilities are intended.

Porting Metrics to new framework - Routing,  ACC, StopSign, Traffic Signals (Aborted) - MP  814, 865, 866, 1013: Generation of Reports using precursor to ADAF.

2.What are areas where you have grown and made improvements?

Generally adhered to better coding practices: made code changes more concise than previously; read through PRs more thoroughly before requesting reviews, resulting in relatively fewer careless errors

Became more timely with PR submissions -  worked longer,  or more thoroughly; tried to be more prompt about clarifying issues and doubts; made sure manager knew status of PR very clearly

Communicated results of PR more transparently: screenshots or videos of Sim; more exhaustive unit testing; wrote up limitations of PR more comprehensively than before. This sped up debugging with Pitt. team, taking away need for guesswork. 

Have a better grasp of C++ coding practices than before, due to independent reading and listening to Argo talks; able to provide better review suggestions; able to spot errors better in reviewed code. 

Reviewed PRs more frequently and promptly; learnt from reviewing multiple PRs from different areas within MP. Discussed PRs at length with their authors for clarification when needed (see coming para).

Persisted with the porting of Traffic signals to Python, and made  considerable progress even though it had to be abandoned due to its complexity

3.Think about not only results, but also about how you collaborate and work with others. Be Specific!

Generally active on #sw-eng, #build, and #infra; provide help to newcomers, and others facing common programming/CI issues I’ve seen before. At MTV, have worked with @kdesai (localisation metrics framework - porting and debugging),  @manoj (General C++ coding; helping debug template issues), @xqiu (Eigen matrix).

Helped @mgilson with writing ASL Wrappers in C++, a language which he wasn’t familiar with.

Uncovered critical bug in Planning Trajectory - and worked with @evenator & @nseegmiller to resolve it

Helped incoming MP team members at MTV: With @dbreeden, served as welcome buddy; helped him set up hardware and software; walked him through MP team history and architecture; ensured he was appraised of latest developments such as Corridor Map and Trajectory Generator improvements, even if not directly involved in them. With @cmcalister, had extensive discussions on multi-threaded traffic light and other PRs; walked through MP team history (as with @dbreeden); ensured his PRs got reviewed on time. 

During code red and in the days prior to the 29/03 Demo, worked closely with @rhukkeri and @jsidhu to ensure simulations using corridor map worked; rebases did not have missing commits; test cases were complete, etc.

Part of that time I was in the Mountain View office so we got to meet in person, he was very communicative on issues and asked a lot of questions to make sure he has a good grasp of how he can solve the tasks assigned to him.  

Ganesh was quick to learn how to write ASL extension libraries to expose information to python. He was one of the first developers I interacted with while developing the data analysis frame work, and he was able to contribute to it in a way that was to his team's advantage.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Ganesh has a solid understanding of C++17 and of the Argo coding standard. I have learned new tricks and idioms from reviewing his PRs, and from his PR reviews. He has increased the number of PRs he reviews. 

Ganesh is motivated. He is willing to take on any task and often volunteers to take on more. 
He now gets PRs up for review more quickly than before. He is also more proactive about asking for clarification before proceeding too far down the wrong path. 

He is personable and professional in his interactions. Recently I was too curt in reviewing some of his PRs and he rightfully asserted that I take a more constructive tone. Since then I’ve tried to be more constructive and he has been receptive to feedback.

Ganesh took a lead role on the implementation of turn signals, which the VOs greatly appreciated once it landed.
I have been working with Ganesh closely on the refactor of the CorridorMapGenerator. He has successfully landed 10+ tickets for this epic. It has been a communication learning experience for us both and I feel we both have made improvements. 

Ganesh has welcomed and helped onboard his new motionplanning teammates in Mountain View.",,,Neal Seegmiller,nseegmiller@argo.ai,Ganesh Peruvemba Kumar,gkumar@argo.ai,Software,

He also contributed to the conversion of the TrajectoryGenerator from the MotionPlan to the CorridorMap object. His biggest contributions recently have been in refactoring the CorridorMapGenerator and with TurnSignal development.  He has been solely responsible for TurnSignal development.  He wrote the design doc, implemented it, and tested it.  

Ganesh has improved the quality of his PRs.  They are a better size, he notes considerations and limitations, and has improved how he takes feedback.  

He works well with others, schedules time to talk through things he has questions on, and is very pleasant to work with.

He helped me get set up, gave me crash courses in topics relevant to our team, and put me in touch with people/Slack channels when I had questions that were better handled by others.  He did this while working nights and weekends leading up to the 3/29 demo.  I don't know if I'd call that a sacrifice, though, because it seems like Ganesh takes masochistic pleasure from working hard.  He will gleefully laud any other people who are still at work when he leaves, which are always few in number.

Regarding Ganesh fostering a one-team attitude: We haven't done it, but Ganesh is the only one who's suggested that the MTV motion planning team actually get together outside of work.  More than once he's Slacked me out of the blue regarding some communication that isn't necessarily targeted to him (e.g., our daily updates on Slack, PRs getting queued on #queue), so he's apparently scouring these channels and taking them seriously.

Otherwise, I have not had much of a chance to work directly with Ganesh on any stories.",,,David Breeden,dbreeden@argo.ai,Ganesh Peruvemba Kumar,gkumar@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Ganesh has been a key developer on several of our critical features over the last two quarters, including turn signals, the corridor map generator,  and our initial work with the metrics framework.

Ganesh's code quality has shown some improvement over this period as he learns Argo's code style and becomes more familiar with our codebase.

Ganesh is very active on slack as a source of both questions and answers. When he isn't sure how to respond to a question or request in a PR review, he usually goes to #sw-eng for a definitive answer. He also answers simple questions from newcomers about how to get things done at Argo. He has also been very helpful in mentoring the new members of the motion planning team in California.

Ganesh should be commended for his productivity and effectiveness when he was the only member of the motion planning team in California, which must have made it harder for him to spin up and communicate with the rest of the team.",,,Ed Venator,evenator@argo.ai,Ganesh Peruvemba Kumar,gkumar@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"Could get better at writing design docs. My turn signal doc had several unforeseen issues, that were later pointed out by @acosta - and I should probably have handled them better.  

Could have generally provided more support to the Pitt team during code red and Demo preparation. Should have proactively asked whether I could have been with them physically for testing AV

Could have been better at reviewing others’ design docs. I observed that a lot of reviews take place in the same morning (E.T.) that design docs are sent out on #mp-internal. Once I catch up with the doc in the morning (P.T.) I feel it’s already too late, for the doc has received a lot of comments.

Could have fixed issues faster/more during Code red, especially the smaller issues which had just a few lines to them. I’m trying to improve on this - e.g. for the latest error code issue sent out by @niko, I was one of the first to respond with a PR - within 1 hr of his email.

Could probably get better at bringing new comer employees up to speed - bringing them up to date  on MP Architecture, advising on better coding guidelines, etc. I feel that I should have more 1-on-1 Zoom meetings with the Pitt team as required for specific issues - outside our normal Sprint and Design  meetings.

Probably could be more active in the Retro when Project scope and quality are discussed. I feel a majority of the discussion is carried out by the Pitt team, but feel that MTV should chip in too.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,At the time worked together he seemed to struggle a little with getting started with some of the work in python.

I think he should work on being more of an independent contributor and owning issues and project he works on no irrespective of the source.  ,,,Gus Atmeh,gatmeh@argo.ai,Ganesh Peruvemba Kumar,gkumar@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"The biggest concern with Ganesh’s PRs continues to be logical errors, particularly errors that aren’t caught by unit tests in the PR and so must be caught by reviewers. I think these errors are often due to not entirely understanding the purpose and use case of the thing he is implementing. Several of the tickets in the CorridorMapGenerator refactor went through several iterations of logically incorrect code. 
Examples:
https://github.com/argoai/av/pull/4979
https://github.com/argoai/av/pull/4930

For my part, I could have done better at splitting up the design into the smallest possible tickets and providing more explicit pseudo-code for each part. But, ultimately we need engineers to progress in their capabilities as follows:
* can implement an explicitly defined solution
* can implement a sketched out solution
* can identify solutions oneself and implement them
* can identify both problems and solutions

Ganesh has made progress and my advice is to continue on this progression. Make sure you fully understand the logic of all PRs you put up. Don’t trust pseudo-code in design docs or github comments, there may be errors. Before starting the implementation, write unit tests and work out by hand what you expect the result to be - never just set the expected result in a unit test to the output of the implementation without verifying it manually. In the case of the CorridorMapGenerator refactor, studying how the old implementation works may have helped to understand the new one. Familiarize yourself with the entire codebase as much as possible.

Continue to seek out tasks where you can take ownership, from design to implementation, as you did for turn signals.
Also continue to speak up in meetings and share your insights. Hopefully integration with the team will be tighter now that there is a contingent of motion planning engineers in Mountain View.",,,Neal Seegmiller,nseegmiller@argo.ai,Ganesh Peruvemba Kumar,gkumar@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"As Ganesh mentioned, he can improve at writing better design docs, perhaps by thinking of what questions people will ask before they read it (which is a common challenge in writing design docs).  

Ganesh can also improve his approach on writing unit tests.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"I can't really speak to areas for growth.  Ganesh isn't the go-to person for any code that I've worked with so far, nor have we collaborated on any projects since I've been here.

I suppose one thing he could do is become a C++ reader and MP code owner so that he can contribute more reviews.",,,David Breeden,dbreeden@argo.ai,Ganesh Peruvemba Kumar,gkumar@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Ganesh's code often requires a lot of iteration to make it through code reviews. He could avoid some of this churn by testing his code more thoroughly before submitting PRs, and by reviewing his own code himself. Viewing the diff on the PR creation page is a great way to catch mistakes you didn't notice while you were implementing code.

Ganesh seems to have some difficulty with git, which is understandable given our Byzantine git workflow. In particular, he needs to be more careful when rebasing that he doesn't introduce errors or merge in changes he didn't mean to.

When reviewing others' code, Ganesh has a tendency to nitpick issues that could probably be left alone, such as whitespace. Almost everyone on the team has been guilty of this one time or another. We could land code faster if we focused on clear code quality issues rather than personal style preferences.

Ganesh should let us know if he has any trouble understanding us in Zoom meetings. Many of our teammates are soft-spoken. Videoconferencing makes communication tough, and if Ganesh can't hear someone, they need to know.",,,Ed Venator,evenator@argo.ai,Ganesh Peruvemba Kumar,gkumar@argo.ai,Software,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Since the acquisition I've mostly been involved in porting the DSP algorithm for the LiDAR data from the GPU to the FPGA.  Worked very closely with Sam and Esther on accomplishing this task.  At this point in time we have the algorithm running real time on the FPGA but are having trouble fitting it into an FPGA that will meet our cost and power requirements.  This will be a very high level priority task over the next month for me.  My main responsibilities on this portion of the design has been the front end section from the ROIC interface up until the bin integration steps where the outputs are fed into the noise tracking and peak searching algorithms.    

During this time I've really had to get better at making test benches that are easily recreated by others and creating python test scripts that verify results without question so that tasks can be closed out in Jira.  Worked very closely with Sam and Esther on this and have weekly meetings to discuss these tasks and as a group I feel we are getting better at using the Jira tools.  These python scripts also ballooned up quite a bit into a small scale LiDAR simulator that allows us to test out detection probability and FPGA results once the full simulation outputs are available.  In doing this and constant some times quite lengthy conversations with Sam, I have learned a great deal about LiDAR systems design and design trade offs.  This has given me a greater appreciation for the data processing that's being done, and hopefully allows me to design the algorithm more efficiently when we start making more trades inside the FPGA.

Since the acquisition we also switched FPGA families and are now using Xilinx devices instead of Altera (Intel).  Learning the new design tools (Vivado & HLS) was a bit of learning curve at first but I feel I have become quite proficient in it fairly quickly.  Learning these new tools while still making the progress on the design was quite a tall task but I think it went fairly smoothly and didn't inhibit our progress too much.

In addition to these tasks I've also been working on a model of the scanner and encoder to determine the azimuth resolution that the FPGA could keep given a number of encoder pulses coming back.  This model really helped sharpen my python skills along with working with Sam and Esther.  Really have become much better at slowing down my pace of work to create a strong software base before digging in on writing the actual functions.  

I think my biggest gain during the last 6 months has been my ability to create software/firmware that is easily usable by others and has a base architecture that makes sense and can be merged into larger designs more easily.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Gennaro implemented the histogramming and BinIntegrator functions for the front end of the Argo Lidar DSP pipeline using VHDL. He also implemented the ROIC interface. He included automated tests in Python to validate the VHDL code. He has closely coordinated with Esther Wei and Sam Wilton on DSP architecture. He’s also been working towards FPGA power and resource estimates which are important to the overall lidar system level design.

I’ve worked with Gennaro on the ROIC interface and specifications and value the discussions with him, the input he provided and his sharing of lessons learned from developments before I joined Argo. He’s provided input on both technical details like key timing relationships and on dealing with individual personalities on our vendor’s design team.

Gennaro is a good team player and has helped several new hires, including myself, get situated and oriented. He has helped people get up to speed on Argo Lidar technology and on our development tools (Vivado/Jira/Git etc) and processes. He’s also helped facilitate a good environment amongst engineers working on different but related hardware and projects. He is helpful in discussing issues/bouncing ideas off of even when it doesn’t directly relate to his work. 
",,,Matthew O'Grady,mogrady@argo.ai,Gennaro Salzano,gsalzano@argo.ai,Hardware,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Gennaro spearheaded the efforts to convert our legacy gmapd signal processing algorithms from CPU implementation to FPGA.  His contributions span throughout the entire signal processing pipeline, but he focused heavily on methods of handling, buffering, parsing, aggregating, and histogramming high-speed raw data streams.  In addition to raw data pre-processing, Gennaro co-developed methods of histogram filtering used to extract target signals from background noise. 

Beyond FPGA development tasks, Gennaro also engaged in learning more about lidar systems architecture and developed lidar simulation tools that aid in dsp and electronics design.  He developed gmapd receiver simulation programs in python to generate simulated raw data streams which can be fed into the FPGA signal processing algorithm pipeline.  He also recently developed models of the scanner and encoder that allow him to virtualize the behavior of control and timing systems to aid in electronics development and determine the precision at which we can maintain consistency in the number of columns per sweep.  I was consistently impressed by his tenacity, rate of progress, and interest in developing knowledge and skills beyond his core area of expertise.  His interest and ability to learn, think, and work in both component level and system level details is a step beyond his current position. 

He has grown significantly and made improvements in a large number of areas. He has learned about signal processing algorithms and geiger mode lidar systems as a whole, and applied these principles to develop simple gmapd lidar models and simulations.  As he continues to develop this knowledge and experience, he will become an valuable asset to lidar systems team research development efforts.  Furthermore, he has seamlessly adopted new development platforms as he switched from Altera to Xilinx tools and Windows to Linux OS.  Additionally, he is continuing to improve and develop his software development skills and approach to object oriented design to develop more modular and maintainable software.

Gennaro is self-driven, productive, insightful, creative, and has a unique balance of hardware and software skills.  He is capable of seeing both the big picture and the small details of complex systems, and has a knack for sensing critical details that most others overlook.  In additional to technical skill, he is also very personable and honest -- which are two critical and synergistic traits necessary for teamwork and leadership.

Score is difficult to choose.  A score of 3, within the context of the Argo levels, is to suggest a direct promotion to staff engineer, which is a stretch given the rarity of this title within the organization.  In due time, with a greater degree of experience and continuing evolution of cross-functional technical abilities and leadership skills, promotion in the future is virtually inevitable.

Gennaro is always conscious of how his design changes may affect other aspects of the LiDAR system (e.g. the absolute position requirements for the rotating platform and what constraints that puts on the mechanical components).

Maintains consistent power budget and data requirements for the FPGA and supporting components.

Gennaro has been helpful in determining encoder requirements and evaluating encoder suppliers by heavily engaging in design discussions and vendor meetings. This is useful for the LiDAR vendor market survey as well as brassboard development with Moog.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"Even though I feel that I've become much better at creating well thought out python and VHDL code, I  still feel there is much more room for improvement.  I'm usually working in a fast paced environment and in addition usually working alone on an FPGA design where if I want to cut corners and skimp on architecture, or commenting, nobody will really complain because nobody is every going to use it until we reach production.  At that point I usually will have an opportunity to clean things up a bit so the code is easier to understand.  That has not been the case this last 6 months.  As a senior engineer I need to become much better at this and set an example for new hires and younger engineers to follow.      

Working closely with Sam and Esther in this period has really helped me appreciate the ability to slow down and create a code base that will grow in a more manageable way in the future.  I feel I could have done a much better job at working on the setup of the projects earlier in the design so that we could have avoided the refactoring of the code and the GIT repository this late in the design.  I think this will be my greatest area of improvement going forward...cause I will not make this mistake again.     

Lastly, I need to get much better at my use of Jira and Github.  This was quite a learning curve at the beginning and I feel as a team we are getting much better at using these tools more efficiently.  I do feel much more comfortable with Jira and Github where I actually have been able to help new hires set things up, but I think we can definitely use these tools more to our advantage and start to track our project velocity more accurately.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"As I am applying for promotion to Sr. Staff Engineer requirements this cycle, let's see it from this point of view.

It builds up and complete from an excellent review in December 2017. 

** Tech lead or manager **
I stroke a better balance those lasts 2 quarters being involved in a lot more technical discussions.

** Actively mentors others in the org at all levels **
Track record with infra, scientist team, perception teams (Engs & managers).
It has been underlined during my previous review from the perception team members in general.
From PI on, here are few select examples outside of my team I actively supported and mentored: Deva (bounded R/T workloads), Peter Carr (How to make CPU/GPU estimates), Etienne (post reorg), Lakshmi (Personal improvements), Larry (Personal improvements), Mike Dacko (troubleshooting) ...

** Proven domain expert who is widely known and recognized in their field. **
Regularly called for conferences, panels and community mentorship outside of Argo (Pycon CA&US, Devopsdays, Google Summer of Code,...).

By simply answering a question on Quora, I just had 100k targeted views on an answer indirectly advertising working at Argo.

** quiet leadership **
 A lot of best practices, engineering culture etc. 
For example:
Camera issue: lead by example, never give up, always go to the data, never assume anything and rush to conclusions.
Mapping pipeline: tradeoff between immediate needs and high quality standard on the architecture (ie. reusing the old implementation through new API checking both marks and unlocking the situation)
Encouraging post mortems and openness

** Design contributions (I probably forgot a ton but on top of my mind) **

- all compute platforms so far (Z0r, Z0, Z1, Z2)
- Lidar pipeline
- Tile mapping
- GPU memory manager
- GPU operations
- Shared memory
- Monorepo
- Logging
- SGU
-  ...


** driving strategic initiatives that cross-cut the entire organization. **
Drove several major pieces of the Perception stack from PCIe buses to Algorithms across 10+ teams.
Helped with developer productivity (see below).

** Finds ways to make the company more efficient **
Argobot is a perfect example of that: drove several features to improve developer productivity. 
The new features last quarter only:

- Now TLs and managers can query the bot for PR pendings for a dev
- Github review notifications sucks and has been fixed with a bot command to tell you on which PRs you have been requested on
- Queue is now able to notify a PR status directly to developers on Slack so they don’t have to actively monitor it.
- Adapted the Queue to the backend infra so it sped up the build time 3 to 4 fold!

** large scope, complex projects and driving them to completion **
- Lidar pipeline
- GPU pipeline 

** Is able to contemplate more than just technical scope, but also cost, timing, and other project management related trade offs. **
- Mapping pipeline: tradeoff between immediate needs and high quality standard on the architecture (ie. reusing the old implementation through new API checking both marks and unlocking the situation)
- Onboard Ground tradeoffs
Team always over delivered at all the critical times for the demos: first Ford demo, second Ford demo with the scope adjusted to meet the business needs and timing.
- Multiple infra related tradeoffs: for example, moved to our homebrewed shared memory system on the GPU pipeline to avoid an hard dependency on infra. 


** identifies areas of technical debt and finds ways to resolve it over time. **
Not only identified but tracked and measured so we know where we stand:
https://argoai.atlassian.net/browse/PI-148

The debt repayment is on time and we don’t make minimum payments.

** Is becoming a sought after expert in their area of expertise externally to the company **
See “Proven domain expert who is widely known and recognized in their field.”. 

** Pushes new concepts and ideas across the company. **
- World view is one with prior ROI. 
- Real time scheduling on GPU.

** Influences broad technical direction and architecture of the system. **
See “quiet leadership” and “engaging in technical design”

** Will employ and evangelize new techniques and methods to make the team more productive. **
See chatops, monorepo, build system.

** Communicates at the executive level with ease ...** 
- Perception v2 was a good example of it, a lot of it is still in implementation today and will be from the detection team.
- Talks on performance for the devs. 
- GTC meeting with Nvidia.

** Is able to work through complex issues across the team and get things done cross-functionally **

Random examples: 
- Design with ML team and PI buddies. 
- Work on systems with Steve. 
- Argo Lidar studies with Chao & Sam.

** Influences teams across the company through reason, expertise, and technical mastery of the subject area. **
System & camera debugging with Infra comes to mind for “reason & expertise” but also multiple influence on methodology, architecture etc.

** Able to facilitate discussions between multiple teams and subsystems and broker the right compromises to achieve a larger goal. **
Mapping and lidar pipeline compromises are good example of that. 

** Sets the strategic direction for major areas of the company. **
The entire perception architecture and systems.

** Impact and influence is unquestionable through a track record of proven results. **
Adding to 2017 accomplishments Q1 Q2 2018 speak for itself:
- Lidar pipeline rewrite, no major issue with it, on time and budget
- GPU pipeline first version, overperforming our OKR by almost 100% on detection
- VLS128i delivered in advance, proving the solidity of the lidar pipeline over the change of sensor, worked with no code change across all the major pipeline components including localization.
- Ground surface: huge improvement in performance probably one of the key factor for the recent improvements on tracking

Guillaume has been a great leader in the past few months. He is that kind of leader that stays on top of everything, provides good visions and fight together with the team by side if necessary. 

As my manager, Guillaume setup a weekly 1:1 meeting that provides a passage for timely communication. This regular meeting has been extremely helpful for me to take any feedback from the management, as well as for myself to give/express feedbacks/concerns.

Guillaume has been helpful on the technical side as well. For example, during the ""post code-red"" time, we were on a really time critical stage to deliver the ground map removal using height map. The final battle was actually to give the solution in one night. Guillaume stayed with the team and even was helping by ""screen-sharing debugging"".

He distributes work to the right people and motivates the team to keep pushing and to keep the quality bar high which is exactly what we need.

I worked with Guillaume helping to spec hardware for upcoming vehicles. His input here was invaluable because he caught some key limitations of the hardware memory bandwidth that were missed by others. Also, his view point balances out others on the team (mostly me) with a more utilitarian view on some pieces of software which helps keeps projects moving.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,report,"Guillaume became my manger since the team reorg on February. During these few months, I pretty much enjoyed working for him.

One of the biggest contribution he made during this cycle is that he built and led the Perception Infrastructure team. He had the vision of filling the gap between the hardware sensors and high level algorithm by creating this domain-specific infrastructure team. This team is built up with talented people owning domain expertise in the field of tracking, detection, mapping and localization. Under his leadership, our team has greatly improved the current system and delivered many new features, which have been widely used across the company. 

One of the projects he guided me through is designing and implementing the GPU pipeline 2.0. He has clear visions and is capable of turning them into the actual action plans. During meetings, he always makes certain that I have a clear understanding of my responsibility. 
He is very patient and keeps lending support and guidance to me every time when I met problems. ",,,Dongran Liu,dliu@argo.ai,Guillaume Binet,gbinet@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,report,"**Direct interactions**

I have enjoyed working for Guillaume, both as a member of the former Detection Team and presently as a member of the Perception Infrastructure Team.  I feel comfortable being open and honest with him during 1:1's, because he is receptive and provides great feedback.  It is clear that Guillaume is conscious of and puts effort into allocating team members to projects that they enjoy.  The projects I have been involved in have been exciting, challenging, and have furthered my ability as a software engineer.  In addition, Guillaume and I will regularly have conversations about my long term interests and goals.  Having a manger that recognizes the importance of employee growth motivates me to work harder. 

**Technical knowledge**

Guillaume has a strong background developing software and his understanding of the technical details furthers his ability to manage the team.  This allows him to allocate the right people to a project, provide input on the design and implementation, and brainstorm about possible issues in the future.  This creates a tight-knit and efficient team dynamic.  I have learned a lot from Guillaume since I joined the group and hope to continue to do so.  

**Project management**

When Guillaume assigns the team to a new project, I feel he has a lot of faith and trust in the group.  There is never a feeling of micro-management nor doubt in our abilities.  He regularly provides constructive and meaningful feedback, but he recognizes the benefit of having an autonomous team. I also feel this furthers employee development, because it builds confidence.

Specific Accomplishments Driven
-> Lidar Pipeiline 
During the lidar pipeline, he helped to manage the processes which completely overhauled the exciting lidar pipeline.  He succesfully managed members 

-> Current and future GPU Pipeline
Guillaume was able to efficiently and effectively manage those on the PI team to bring together to deliver a working basic gpu pipeline for initial integration onto the vehicle during code red.  He was able to talk to infra and detection to maintain an open line of communication between the two teams in solving these issues.  Specifically, when we were having gpu ring buffer issues guillaume was able to lead engineers down the right path to correctly diagnose and patch the issues.

-> Camera Frame dropping issues
During the infamous camera dropping issues gbin was an incredible asset in solving many different types of problems.  While inspecting packets from the camera to the rest of the system, he was able to manage the various networking related tasks which helped to successfully diagnose the issues at hand.

Gbin has also been very supportive in supported my professional and personal growth.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Gbin is a terrific engineer and team lead. In the short amount of time I interacted with him, I have seen how deep his architecture, hardware, and optimization knowledge is. You don't expect an engineer whose favorite language is python to be such an optimization expert. 

Gbin's citable contributions during the time I was at Argo has been delivering Z2/J1 compute budgets, helping me design the lower level implementation details of some of our new algorithms, a much better (and hopefully final) lidar pipeline, GPU memory management, and Shared memory. These are only the ones I observed -- there might be more. 

His contribution with the argobot is also incredible. Probably saved Argo thousands of developer hours. 

His external visibility with his contributions to the python community, as well as talks on performance are also improving our branding. 

His support for our ML-PI buddy program to mitigate the `throw over the wall` problem was also great. 

As far as Argo is concerned, Gbin is one of the critical brains that bridges algorithms to infrastructure, and I am super fond of working with him.

This team took critical concerns in the system which had been previously diluted throughout the organization, and provided a team which not only owns these concerns directly, but also provides team members to help consumers benefit from the team efforts (e.g. PI buddy system).

As PI lead, the leadership of the LiDAR Pipeline struck a good balance between ensuring that high level concerns (timeline, budget, inter-team interactions) were met, helping guide low-level concerns (providing design review feedback, addressing technical questions), and addressing inter-personal issues (helping broker compromises, communicating with team to understand issues). This was done without micro-managing or focusing on the wrong details.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Accomplishments & Strengths: 

1) I filled in as MC lead when Scott Varnhagen was out of the office for 2 weeks in December 2017. I was in charge of making sure we the team was on schedule for the planned features and work. I also coordinated setting up a weekly report system for the MC team as part of the teams reporting to Al Costa. I also made sure that AI tickets were addressed from an MC perspective. This Displays that I have grown my leadership skills and that I am able to ensure high quality code is delivered by my team. It lso shows that I have a wide knowledge of MC stack, which allows me to  answer questions on issues in meetings and otherwise as well as resolve issues. 

2) Worked on a design for the MC requirements on the MP path see google doc here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AJSKBDqIu5OatecN54AZWIG-GarBnITPScE_CcGxQGk/edit#heading=h.7flbfqtlomc8 
This project displays my deep understanding of in vehicle dynamics and controls, as well as my ability to articulate complex design concepst to other teams. My design grounded in theory and shows experience in challenging engineering work

3) Designed, built, deployed ADAF (Argo Data Analysis Framework) https://argoai.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MC/pages/108003462/Argo+Data+Analysis+Framework+ADAF 
In this project I applied broad (data analysis) and deep (motion control) knowledge to design the tool and API. I used self-directed methods to design the ADAF tool to use a system of “submodules” that are dynamically loaded. This makes the tool versatile and modular which allows for many use cases
When teams started using it I was became the Go-To person for ADAF
Designed the tool to be independent of log source, this helped integrate tool into the sim cloud regression framework (worked with Arjuna Ariyaratne), this shows foresight
ADAF has had broad impact, MP (Ganesh Kumar), SIM (Yue Han), PA (David Lenkner), LOC (Kunal Desai), AInt, and others use the tool
Drove teams to success with this impact since they use the sim regression framework. 
ADAF also helped my team be more data driven see reports hosted on http://motioncontrol-reports.argoai.tools/ 
This project was one of the early python projects at Argo that grew so large in scale, and it went through multiple changes in the python coding standard as well as python version. I always pushed for keeping up to date with the coding standard as well as best practices in python. 

4) I also worked on a project to build an automated system identification tool in python, see the following report for results http://motioncontrol-reports.argoai.tools/vehicle_model_sys_id/2018-04-03/vehicle_model_sys_id_report.html 
This tool allowed me to discover deficiencies in the models used by MC and updated them. 
Updating these models led to a major re-factor of the vehicle dynamics class in simulation https://github.com/argoai/av/pull/4204. This displays my ability to take on projects independently and adapt to their requirements to see them through all the way

5) I wrote most of the diagnostics code and logic in the path follower and AutoboxUDPTask during code red, see the following PRs https://github.com/argoai/av/pull/2157 and https://github.com/argoai/av/pull/2157 
The work done for these PRs shows my ability to take ownership of issues regardless of source and help see them through to closure 
This project was early on when the diagnostics framework came online, and therefore shows that I lead in using new tools and providing feedback to other teams. 

6) I supported much of the triage and on vehicle operations during code red testing of the release candidate 
My name is mentioned in the planning document for testing code since I was one of few developers in Dearborn who were able to run the vehicle at the time. This shows broad knowledge of the system and keeping up to date with changes across the org (Shipit was brand new at the time) https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gtl2cLxEPDIFuJN0V2llKKNdhTjD3P-xB0c_tCbmRBI/edit 
I worked on a lot of triage cases related to tracker delays, pose timeouts and trajectory timeouts. This work shows my ability to navigate ambiguity and communicate issues to corresponding parties. Here is a document summarizing some of the triage efforts that I conducted over a weekend with Tom Petroff  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KRLXNWljMOB-4T5gnq0V2dLhZRlM_JnPg0SxqX9xNCc/edit#  

7) From a debugging pespective, I worked on a bug in the the longitudinal acceleration filtering at MC level. A summary of the approach and findings can be found in this document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_hDNssbIdJT7uzzUpV7kXCbcUmiETLO2QPTJMts4rpc/edit
This work shows that I always go with a data driven approach for debugging and finding a solution. I have solid engineering skills that allow me not only to write good code but also find solutions to complex problems. document also shows that I am methodical in debugging issues, as well as clear and concise in communicating them

8) One of the expansions to ADAF that I worked on was  a Multi-log overlay analysis capability where data from logs can be overlayed for comparison. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vnctnBoouwuSsWlgoZjxKMUppB5srAiC_uVjq7u00Ag/edit#heading=h.7flbfqtlomc8
This project has been used on multiple occations for comparing some regressions in software releases as well as AI tickets by the MC team. It will be used to its full potential by the MC team where it will be used to compare autonomous and manual driving behaviour to make for a more naturalistic driving experience. 

9) Path follower resim https://github.com/argoai/av/pull/4076  
Path follower is a major task and any issues that it runs into are critical so they must be quickly diagnosed
I noticed MC has had trouble debugging path follower issues in the past, and while handling an AI ticket myself I noticed that having resim capabilities would save me a lot of time
My work on this project shows my ability skills to foresee issues and provide pragmatic solutions to them. 

10) MC simulation regression testing is an area I have been focused on this past cycle. I have designed a lot of scenarios and made an MC regression test design that I hope to implement soon 
Scenarios for coast and cut-ins https://docs.google.com/document/d/1beApP3S2VI8B9_r0VOZCk-qvb2bHL2vaWMk1cVHzhKA/edit https://docs.google.com/document/d/19CEaNUUazYM1NhZgdk62U1Ye7D3rPxuGvVBzBum3BOI/edit 
Full regression testing https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-fp_sgV_PnY0DEdY30aKAnVFBoZDzEc1pJw8tX2eyCc/edit#heading=h.7flbfqtlomc8 

11) Another contribution of mine for debugging is the refactor the refiner visualization tools to be able to see all trajectory results. See PR https://github.com/argoai/av/pull/4835 and https://github.com/argoai/av/pull/5016 
This will allow MC to be able to find the root cause for any refiner (solvers) issues fast. 
It is being used for closing out triage and AI issues https://argoai.atlassian.net/browse/MC-1009 
This is among the contributions that I made that will have cross-team impact, since it will aid in diagnosing MP issues as well as MC issues

12) I have had sustained contributions in code last performance cycle. Averaging 1000 lines if code a week landing in develop since November 2017

13) I supported demo operations along with Alice Kassar in Pittsburgh for MC issues. We evaluated vehicle veering performance on the demo route and developed a fix. I also got a change to meet many people and acquire as much information in person from them.  

14) I have also volunteered to support the CI taskforce and help turn all the CI checks green. I consider this a big accomplishment since I was able to have a very broad impact on the org by finding a bug in the Cereal library that was causing our CI sanitizers to fail. 

Areas I have grown
1) The most area I have grown in is my python coding skills. By building ADAF and implementing data analysis and system ID tools for MC I have substantially grown my understanding of python. I have also reviewed many PRs for code to go into ADAF, this allowed me to better understand the language and learn new skills.

2) I have also grown my skills in using docker for deploying code to the vehicle and building my own custom images and using them for my advantage. I have since been able to use all my tools in the argo environment and therefore require minimal changes before making contribution. I have also shared some of those tools by adding them to the docker development image, tools like Jupyter Notebooks. 

3) One more area I have acquired more skill in is using Argo tools for debugging and issue triage. Tools such as  aws CLI, log replay, and visualization plugins and widgets. These skills have been developed out of necessity to triage on vehicle issues as well as address autonomy integration issues. 

4) A less technical skill, but equally as important, has been my leadership and communications skills. I have had to work with multiple developers across many teams for ADAF. I worked with them on adding new features, finding bugs, making fixes, as well as explaining and defending design choices to them. I also had to coordinate a lot of the work accross teams to avoid any duplication of efforts. All of this happened through meetings and discussions, which have allowed me to enhance my skills in communications and leadership.

Excellent depth of understanding as well as clarity in explanation.  That was important both in implementing some initial metrics scripts in PyASL and in knowing what to query/view from Parquet formats.
- initial implementation, support, improvement, dissemination of the ADAF framework which now facilitates sim metrics, key to STS.  he has helped standardize on that and also flesh it out to handle the bulk of log metrics.  well-documented, carefully thought out and well implemented.

- Changing the acceleration constraints of the longitudinal refiner based on the grade and the maximum torque  available on the powertrain.
- Implemented a resim capability for the path follower
- Implemented visualization for the iterative refiners 
- Performed system identification on the vehicles

Ghassan is good at communicating with other teams, to deliver or receive the needed information.  He is the person who implemented ADAF which multiple groups are using now. Lots of people come to him for help or questions. Ghassan is great  and efficient at providing help.

But I feel like I have not advanced my C++ skills as much. I am aware that coding skills always evolve and are part of continuous learning, but I should focus more on growing and improving my C++ skills with new projects. 

A project I could have done better was ADAF. Originally it was designed for use by MC team so that developers can conduct analysis of logs and debug issues. It then slowly grew for the use of the MP team, but for a similar purpose. Then however, the number of users exploded to developers from SIM, PA, LOC, and even AInt using it sometimes in vehicle to debug issues. When it was deployed to everyone in a short period of time they started using it in many creative ways, but not the way it was designed to be used. It would have been better if it was originally designed to accommodate all that, and would have probably saved some time that went into reactive feature additions, but I did not envision it to become this big this fast.

Another area of value across the team would be in managing allocations for hardware components in an organized way.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Henry is a great addition to the team and has made contributions to several tools in his time at Argo.  My most recent and substantial collaborations with Henry have been for the Object Point Cloud Labeler and Operator management.  For the OPCL Henry was one of the primary developers, and I was the reviewer for some of the more recent features.  I am impressed by Henry's ability to ramp up on 3D tools and dive into the OPCL problem space.  With operator management, Henry added a few features that involved both front-end and back-end code, including integrating with other services.  He is able to quickly grasp the inner workings of a system and fit solutions into the existing architecture.  After reviewing the existing job creation wizards he was able to implement another form and add novel asynchronous error reporting features.  As he mentioned in his self review, he also integrated OM with the shared authorization service.  

As a team member it is very easy to work with Henry.  When helping with OM he was willing to take on any task.  He was great at openly communicating about necessary changes, both in circumstances where he was looking for examples and when he was bringing new solutions to the tool.  He also takes feedback well and is willing to push back with sufficient evidence when he disagrees.  I look forward to working with Henry again.",,,Adam Smith,asmith@argo.ai,Henry Burke-Sweet,hburkesweet@argo.ai,Software,

I switched between development of the tools with minimum support. When I helped out on operator management, I was the one who explained to me peer how the authentication integration worked (as well as identifying an issue with the current implementation and correction).

I helped to build OPCL from the ground up.  I implemented a shared scheme approach including throttling with an update scheme to prevent unnecessary re-renders of the context clouds.  The overall implementation is fairly simple, despite the surprising complexity required for selection, cuboid creation, and cuboid editing.",,,Henry Burke-Sweet,hburkesweet@argo.ai,Henry Burke-Sweet,hburkesweet@argo.ai,Software,

Even though our hire dates were not terribly far apart he seems to have acquired a large amount of knowledge quickly on various systems which was very useful when working on projects with him. 

His code has been clean and well formed and his reviews do a great job of catching problems. I'm confident that he will continue to keep ARGOs code quality high.

A specific example of excellence was when we were deploying and migrating the track labeler.  He put in the extra weekend time and his assistance over that weekend was invaluable in making sure we didn't block other teams.

He has worked on nearly every tool that the Labeling Team owns and has made significant contributions to all of them.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"I started working with Henry more closely during the development of the Object Point Cloud Labeler in January.  He proved to be very capable and self-sufficient in that effort.  Together, we delivered the original scope for the minimum viable product almost meeting the very aggressive schedule.  He focused on the user interaction elements while I focused on the data retrieval, manipulation, and transformation.  After the MVP, Henry has continued to enhance the OPCL with new features, most notably the addition of cuboids and all of the UI elements, data manipulation, and even Blinky server-side changes needed to support them.

If I recall correctly, Henry had not worked with TypeScript before OPCL, whereas I had a head start with Overwatch being my first experience with TypeScript.  Even though TypeScript is built on top of JavaScript, properly written TypeScript code is very different from typical JavaScript.  From an object-oriented design perspective, TypeScript has more in common with other statically-typed, class-based inheritance languages such as Java than it does with JavaScript's dynamically-typed, prototypal inheritance paradigm.  That can be a pretty big leap for some engineers to take.  Henry didn't seem to have any trouble making that leap.  His history of pull requests for OPCL exhibit a good trajectory of increasing knowledge and proficiency with TypeScript, learning from feedback on his PRs and incorporating them into subsequent PRs so as to not repeat the same mistakes.  He responds well to reviews on his PRs and in one case came back with a revised implementation so elegant it could be hung up on a plaque (argoai/labeling#1689, discussed further in section 2).

Overall, it was a pleasure to work with Henry on OPCL and can't wait to see what else he is going to build on the Labeling Tools team.  OPCL has a bright future in his capable hands.",,,William Lai,wlai@argo.ai,Henry Burke-Sweet,hburkesweet@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"I agree with Henry's self assessment with respect to boldness in code reviews.  He has good input and  should feel free to enforce standards and assert his opinions.  Code reviews are one of the primary ways that we have to learn from out teammates (both reviewer and reviewee) so I am always in favor of detailed discussion there.

One recommendation for Henry is to take a few minutes to do a quick self review of the code and tool when delivering PRs.  This can help catch some of the minor issues that have popped in a couple of reviews.  For example a quick run of the application in a few use cases would have found the issue from PR #2037 that prevented OM auth from working if the user was not logged in when the app started, and the distortion issues from rendering OPCL bounding cuboid size guides.  Similarly, looking through the commits in github diff view for a PR can make it easier to see various issues, including rebase/merge issues like with the recent duplicated tests.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,manager,"Don't be afraid to ask for help.  There were a few instances where being willing to ask for some help would have likely saved some time.
Think about spending some time with the team.  Lunches, etc...  This might help make you more comfortable asking for help.",,,Randy Warner,randyw@argo.ai,Henry Burke-Sweet,hburkesweet@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"During the development of OPCL, there were several instances where Henry started implementing a feature or design pattern that ended up being more complicated than necessary.  It wasn't until the feature/design pattern was fully implemented and submitted in a PR that we had a chance to discuss alternative, simpler approaches that were also usually better for the OPCL user.  As Henry continues to gain more experience as an engineer, he should develop a more refined intuition/gut feeling for when something seems more complicated than necessary.  When that complexity spidey-sense goes off, it would be a good opportunity to pause implementation and have a quick design discussion with peers to see if we can get to those alternative, simpler approaches earlier in the development process.  Examples of this that come to mind are:

- rendering custom cursors with React views in argoai/labeling#1229 when a CSS cursor image was simpler and more performant
- wrangling another engineer's JavaScript code into TypeScript in argoai/labeling#1322 when the JavaScript code exhibited questionable design decisions even for JavaScript standards, much less TypeScript
- manually calculating a distance projection for cuboid creation in argoai/labeling#1689 when a three.js built-in projectOnVector() function was simpler and led to more intuitive behavior for users

There were also several occasions where the code that was implemented was ""eh, good enough"" but not generalizable or provably correct, similar to how Track Labeler camera controls were at one point simply good enough that it moved in the correct direction but the magnitude of movement was arbitrarily and/or incorrectly calculated.  This leads to poor, frustrating user experiences.  While the requirements never once spelled out mathematically-precise calculations for camera controls, as front-end engineers the responsibility lies solely on us to delight users with interfaces so natural that they seamlessly meld into the union of mind and machine, rather than so cumbersome that they cause the minds to despise the machine.  The quality of the user interface has a direct impact to the bottom line of label production volume.  The more the users have to fight the application, the fewer labels the user and application are going to produce and the lower quality they will be.  Examples of this that come to mind are:

- awkward zooming behavior that zoomed into fixed center points, replaced by a more natural zoom into the mouse cursor in argoai/labeling#1464
- pan boundaries that were close to correct for some zoom levels but way off for others, also corrected in argoai/labeling#1464
- orthographic camera frustum boundaries that seemed fine for data that occurred within a certain range of values, but made the camera useless when data occurred outside of that range (corrected by LBL-1904)

These instances are infrequent enough that I would not hold anything against Henry overall.  Math can be challenging and it's surprising how much of it comes into play when dealing with 3D graphics.  I think Henry is already learning from these instances and incorporating the necessary rigor into his more recent efforts with cuboid creation and color schemes.  Once he does so and demonstrates that he can own the design and development of a complete, high-quality application without needing a more senior engineer to look out for these things, he would be well on his way to the next level.  For now, he solidly meets expectations for an Eng II.  I still have a lot trouble accepting 2/5 as the ""Overall Performance Score"" for meeting expectations as it creates a ton of cognitive dissonance and is almost certain to be interpreted incorrectly without explicit Performance Review training.  I am going to emphasize that Henry solidly meets expectations 5 months in and select the appropriate rating for that, however poorly constructed it may be on a numerical scale.",,,William Lai,wlai@argo.ai,Henry Burke-Sweet,hburkesweet@argo.ai,Software,

He didn't have any prior experience with AV's before Argo, however - Howard has efficiently learned and adapted the knowledge gained to become very resourceful and knowledgeable with the AV's.

Howard, amongst other vehicle techs as well, has traveled to our multiple locations at the drop of a dime to help support our efforts elsewhere such as Dearborn and Miami.  Anytime I have had a question or even just wanted an issue to be looked at, Howard is thorough in his explanations of the issues themselves and also as to what that car (if still being hindered by anything) is or is not capable of doing when it comes to vehicle missions.

If it's a written procedure or process that needs to be done a particular way - you can trust that Howard will follow the letter of the law.  Howard started when we had one other vehicle tech at the time.  However, the other vehicle tech that we had was not here long before leaving Argo.  Through a collaborative effort and his own diligence, Howard was brought up to speed on the AV's.  Since that time, we have added a few other techs.  Howard has been a big part of bringing them along and teaching them the things he had to learn the ""hard way"" early on (hard because other than Joe Serbin, there wasn't another tech to reference how or why certain things were done, in Joe's absence).  

Howard has been great also about reminding me of what cars he may need in the near future to allow us to be more efficient and proactive with the fleet to minimize the downtime.  This is huge for us because it still allows us to have work done to the vehicles without severely impacting missions (if at all).  He's in early enough that he can get to some of the work before we even arrive for shift that day - which has been huge for us as well.

Overall, Howard is an excellent co-worker and someone I believe is another huge asset to our team at Argo.",,,Anuruk Buranathanit,aburanathanit@argo.ai,Howard Lampel,hlampel@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"During the push to have the camera voltage update carried out, Howard came into work very early to get all the kits ready for the day shift(4 AM). This enabled the rest of the team to hit the ground running and get the majority of the updates done. The few that were left, Howard then came in on Saturday and finished up on his own. This enabled us to get all the updates done in just 3 days time.  Howard has also been an integral part in supporting Dearborn. During the transition to find another technician Howard has put forth a lot of time away from home, and has volunteered to support Miami as well.

In the first months of his employment at Argo, he was just trying to assimilate and make sure he was doing what we (Argo AI) wanted done. While this appears to be a lack of confidence on his part, I for one know it is not. It is just Howard's way of making sure he is checking all the boxes (crossing the ""t's"" and dotting the ""i's"").

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Unfortunately, I wasn't nearly as involved in the Track Labeler improvements as I would have liked to be, since I was 100% committed to the Object Point Cloud Labeler development at the time.  However, when I finally got back to reviewing some of Ian's Track Labeler pull requests, I was pleased to see how much better the application had become.  Saving and loading, as Ian mentioned, was huge, but for me personally argoai/labeling#1915 was the biggest win.  I can't believe we shoved that kind of atrocious panning behavior down those poor labeling operators' throats for so long.  I would have quit on the spot if I was told I had to put up with that 40 hours a week.

I've only just begun working with Ian more closely on the Operator Management Task QA.  I'm glad he is proactively driving its development while I continue to be distracted by the 2D/3D projection and calibration issues related to the Traffic Signal Localizer and Object Point Cloud Labeler.  He had some solid ideas for a more general commenting system that I can't wait to see take shape after we finish the initial version specific to OM tasks.

It's only been a few months but Ian solidly meets expectations for an Eng II ramping up and contributing to the LME team.  Personally, I still have a lot trouble accepting 2/5 as the ""Overall Performance Score"" for meeting expectations as it creates a ton of cognitive dissonance and is almost certain to be interpreted incorrectly without explicit Performance Review training.  I am going to emphasize that Ian solidly meets expectations 2.5 months in and select the appropriate rating for that, however poorly constructed it may be on a numerical scale.",,,William Lai,wlai@argo.ai,Ian Volkwein,ivolkwein@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Ian is a strong member of the labeling team and utilized his previous 3D tooling experience to quickly improve the usability of the track labeler.  Adding the save/load capabilities was a big win for the users of the tool.  

Ian has also played a large role in the mapping QA upgrades and worked to design portions of the original plans.   For implementation he pushed for the extraction of the operator-management-common module which will make it much easier for all of the tools to interface with OM for QA.  In general I've been impressed with Ian's ability to see the connection between the tools and learn new areas quickly so that he can contribute in multiple areas.  

As all of the moving parts for the QA feature come together it's been very easy to work with Ian.  He's an open communicator and is always willing to help debug, collaborate, or provide advice.  I really appreciate that he is pushing for more shared modules.  It's not always feasible to spend time creating components that can be shared, but I'd like to follow his example and try to do it more often. ",,,Adam Smith,asmith@argo.ai,Ian Volkwein,ivolkwein@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"When hired, I was put in charge of making the track labeler more usable. This included:
- Migration of track labels to blinky
- Adding ability to save / load (still can't believe we didn't have this before now...)
- UI Improvements to make cuboid creation much faster, easier and more intuitive. 

Personally I think I added a lot of value to the track labeler over my first month and a half and have gotten up to speed with many products and systems that are being used. I've accomplished my goal of improving frontend experiences and the time spent acquiring familiarity with ARGOS tools/systems should make UI improvement much easier and faster for future stories.",,,Ian Volkwein,ivolkwein@argo.ai,Ian Volkwein,ivolkwein@argo.ai,Software,

He has a strong grasp of user needs.  His suggestions have all greatly improved the usability and polish of the track labeler tool (face highlights, saving anytime, etc).  Also I have been impressed by how well he interacts with the LMP team to address their issues.  When we discovered the label type saving issue (in that new types added would cause save to fail), he was very good at articulating what the problem was, what the operator needed to do to work around the issue in the short term, and defining the timeline of when the problem would be resolved.",,,Henry Burke-Sweet,hburkesweet@argo.ai,Ian Volkwein,ivolkwein@argo.ai,Software,

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Ian made a good point in his self-review about the balance between pace and quality.  One recommendation for Ian is to assess the cost/feasibility of addressing technical debt later when examining potential shortcuts in the short-term.  For example, when originally planning to extract the operator-management-common module from operator management  there were many files staged to be extracted simply for ease of managing dependencies, however, we would have bloated the shared module and it would be harder to fix it later.  We eventually came to an agreement to pull less files so this didn't become a problem in the code, but it's something to keep in mind.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Since joining Argo, I have worked and delivered on multiple high-impact strategy and partnership projects. I drove initiatives that have helped grow and improve Argo in meaningful ways, from near-term projects such as city selection to longer-term efforts including OEM #2 and Goods Delivery. I have developed domain expertise in multiple areas of mobility, including the AV industry, automotive OEMs, goods delivery, and ridesharing. I have also collaborated cross-functionally and taken broad responsibility for the development of numerous projects. Through these efforts, I have demonstrated sustained performance commensurate with Level 5 on the Strategy Team. Below, I highlight key projects and personal strengths that demonstrate my consistent performance at the “Senior Business Strategy” level.

**High-Impact Projects**

- **Beach-head City #2** – I became involved in selecting our first beach-head city, Miami, on my very first day at Argo. Over the course of this project, I became a key contributor to the Miami selection process. I then took the lead on selecting our second beach-head city, Washington DC. I worked closely with Ford’s AV strategy team as well as our Vehicle Ops, Systems, Strategy, and SW team leads to research and propose a recommendation to Argo and Ford Leadership. I drove our selection process, which consisted of a technical assessment of city-specific driving dynamics, as well as regulatory, market sizing, and geographic/topology/weather analyses. As part of this effort, I also traveled to Philadelphia, Washington DC, and New York to perform on-site rideshare assessments, which enabled us to gain a qualitative understanding of each city. Once our analysis was complete, I helped present our work to Argo and Ford Leadership, who subsequently approved our recommendation. 

- **OEM #2** – 
 
  *Prioritization* –  I led the research initiative informing our partner prioritization for OEM #2. This project was a comprehensive research effort that synthesized information on every major automotive OEM (excluding China) and analyzed their suitability as a potential partner for Argo. I presented our analysis and recommendation on OEM prioritization to Argo Leadership, who approved and adopted these recommendations as the company’s OEM prioritization strategy.

 As part of this research effort, I created a comprehensive deck detailing every major automotive OEM that could be a potential second OEM partner for Argo. This deck provided analyses on mobility strategies, L4 investment/development efforts, and Ford market overlap. I also created a detailed profile on each OEM, describing their current business and key aspects of their automotive, AV, and mobility strategies. In addition to informing our OEM prioritization strategy, this deck provides valuable context and information for our leadership team as they continue to engage with various OEM #2 partners. Through this project, I have also developed a deep strategic understanding of automotive OEMs, from the market dynamics of their core businesses to their AV/mobility investments, development efforts, and partnerships.

 *Strategy Frameworks* – Working with Cynthia, I structured various strategy frameworks for engaging with potential OEM #2 partners, which has helped inform our approach as we begin conversations with these companies. 

 *Deal Support* – I provide our leadership team with key presentation materials as they engage in conversations with four major OEM partners (projects Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Gemini). In developing these materials, I play a significant role in crafting key messages that outline the case for why Argo is a compelling AV partner and communicate Argo’s point-of-view on OEM partnership philosophy to prospective OEM partners. Additionally, I provide briefing materials for our leadership team ahead of major meetings, ensuring that they are up to date on our partners’ latest developments.  

- **Goods Delivery** – Since joining Argo, I have helped take goods delivery from a nascent idea to a fully-developed proposal for a new vertical at Argo. This proposal was recently reviewed both by Argo’s Management Team and Board of Directors. I worked extensively with Rob Park (on the finance team) and Anne Widera (our external consultant), to develop a financial model for this segment and played an instrumental role in shaping and testing our financial assumptions.

 Throughout this project, I led multiple aspects of the analysis, working cross-functionally and often serving as the liaison between Argo’s technical teams, finance team, and our external consultant. These efforts resulted in a highly detailed financial model for this prospective business. Key aspects that I drove on this project included:

 - Leading a deep-dive brainstorming session with Brett Browning, Wesley Ford, and Mike Happold to understand the various HW & SW tradeoffs in designing a VDS for a goods delivery vehicle.

  - Developing strong working relationships with both Niv Chandrasekaran and Ken Jackson on the Systems Team. I worked closely with Niv to identify a set of viable sensor suite configurations for a new goods delivery vehicle. I also collaborated with Ken to analyze the technical and financial implications of AV power draw requirements.

  - Working with Rob Park and Nancy Fang (our new Strategy Analyst) to incorporate the power draw analysis developed with Ken into our financial model. This analysis demonstrated the challenges of using BEVs as a potential goods delivery vehicle platform.

  - Researching and identifying OEMs and potential vehicle platforms that we could use as a goods delivery vehicle.

 - Working closely with the Ford Strategy and Finance teams to understand their TaaS fleet management assumptions, which informed our fleet management modeling for goods delivery.  

 I also helped create key Strategy Team presentations for Argo’s Leadership, Management Team, and Board of Directors on the goods delivery opportunity. These presentations allowed our team to clearly and effectively communicate the potential opportunity of goods delivery for Argo.  

 Working on this project has also enabled me to develop domain expertise on the goods delivery business, including market dynamics, industry players, and the key economic drivers of this business for Argo (e.g., batching rates, delivery pricing, development costs, and AV power draw considerations).

- **Partnerships** – I have significantly increased my involvement in partnerships by taking on additional responsibilities that fall outside the scope of my strategy role. I facilitated an introduction to DiDi and am participating in our discussions with them. DiDi could potentially become a transformational partner for Argo, opening up an avenue for a possible presence in China, additional sources of funding, and new OEM partnerships. More recently, I have begun to source and conduct calls with smaller tech companies that could potentially bolster Argo’s development - either through an acquihire or through a partnership. I have researched and screened prospective companies prior to presenting them to our leadership team or the appropriate team lead. For example, I identified and established a connection with Phantom Auto, a remote ops company in Mountain View, and worked with Brett, Pete, Bryan, and Cynthia to assess their technology. Although we found their technology compelling, we ultimately did not end up pursuing a business relationship.  

- **Performance Review Process** – Last fall, I worked closely with Matt Williams to implement Argo’s first performance review cycle. I set up and managed Lattice, helped determine review timelines, created company-wide messaging, composed training session materials, answered employee questions, and compiled scores for calibration sessions. I also worked closely with the IT team to combine the written feedback with the post-calibration score into one cohesive performance review report for each employee. My work on this project meaningfully contributed to a smooth and seamless review process for Argo. We continue to use these same presentations, tools, and processes as part of this current performance review cycle.  Based on my efforts and results, I was recommended by Matt Williams for a spot bonus in recognition of my going above and beyond expectations and for delivering on a project with high-impact for Argo. 

**Leadership**

- **Strong relationship with Ford** – I have established and continue to maintain strong relationships with key members of the Ford AV Team, including Elyse Oyer (Strategy), Alexandra Ford (Pilots), Tom Walsh (Partnerships), Steve Lawrence (Data), Matt Tinnon (Business Development), and Todd Hanson (Finance). To maintain these relationships, I have regular face-to-face meetings (travelling to Dearborn or Pittsburgh every ~6 weeks) and weekly check-ins with my direct Ford counterparts (Elyse & Tom). I also attend Ford’s bi-weekly AV Strategy Meeting. Building goodwill and a strong rapport with my counterparts at Ford has helped me establish an effective communication channel and a productive working relationship on various joint Ford-Argo strategy projects, such as City Selection.

- **Mentorship** – I provide day-to-day direction and guidance to Nancy, our Strategy Analyst hired in late March. For Nancy’s first day at Argo, I prepared a detailed welcome letter outlining her onboarding process, key team resources, and an overview of her initial strategy projects. In addition to overseeing Nancy’s onboarding, I play an instrumental role in mentoring Nancy by providing regular training and feedback, as well as conducting weekly 1:1s. I continue to help Nancy ramp up on strategy team projects and work with her to help define career goals and establish a clear growth trajectory at Argo. I also help Cynthia with various Strategy Team initiatives, such as leading our weekly team meeting.

- **Hiring** – I led the hiring process for our Strategy Analyst and Summer MBA Intern. As part of this process, I outlined the qualifications for each position and guided the recruiting team in our search. Between the two positions, I reviewed 200+ resumes, conducted 30+ phone screens, and performed 10+ final round interviews. I refined our search criteria for the Summer MBA Intern position based on the Analyst recruiting process. These updates to our search process resulted in an exceptionally strong Summer MBA Intern candidate pool; I received positive feedback form the interview panel, noting the strength of our final-round MBA Intern candidates. 

**Execution, Teamwork, & Communication**

- **Presentations to Leadership** – Since joining Argo, I have become the go-to person for producing key presentation decks. I regularly create presentation materials for Argo and Ford Leadership, including Argo’s quarterly update to Ford Executives, Ford Executive visits (Jim Farley, Chris Brewer), as well as materials for Argo’s Management Team Summit and Board of Director meetings.
 
 I also created key presentation decks for discussions with OEM #2 partners and DiDi. In developing these decks, I was instrumental in crafting and communicating the case for why Argo is a compelling AV partner.  In addition to these externally-shared materials, I developed briefing materials for our leadership team ahead of key meetings with prospective partners. I have received positive feedback from both Bryan and Cynthia noting that these briefs have been very helpful. 
 
 By producing 50+ presentation decks since joining Argo, I have honed my skills in communicating key strategic messages to senior leadership at Ford, Argo, and prospective partners. I also work cross-functionally with other teams to create presentation materials. For example, I worked closely with Matt Powers to clearly articulate Argo’s new method for measuring progress, which we used in materials for Jim Farley, Chris Brewer, Ford executives (“the Magic 4”), and our Board of Directors. Through my presentation work, I have been able to effectively communicate Argo’s point-of-view and contribute ideas to help influence external partners (such as Ford and perspective OEM #2 partners). 

- **News updates and postings** – I established and maintain a regular cadence of AV-industry news updates to Argo’s leadership team and weekly news updates to Argo employees and the Ford AV team. These weekly updates are now sent to a growing group of 15+ AV team members and executives at Ford, including Sherif Marakby, Chris Brewer, Brian Wolf, Alan Hall, and Dragos Maciuca, as well as John Cassesa (one of our board members). I have received positive feedback from numerous leadership and team members at both Argo and Ford on how these updates are highly helpful, well-written, and informative. Moreover, the structure of theses postings is now being used by Sherif’s team at Ford as a template for their internal comms/news updates.

- **Company Business Plan Updates** – I worked closely with Rob, Nancy, Cynthia, and Ming to update Argo’s P&L Model as part of an update to the company’s Business Plan. I informed updates to the P&L model that better reflected our city-by-city service coverage as well as our city roll-out schedule. Furthemore, I helped drive updates to key model assumptions, including a more refined view on trip length and frequency. I also served as a liaison with the Ford Strategy team, which helped us to explicitly delineate Ford’s fleet sizing assumptions versus our own. 

 As part of this P&L update, I helped model the effect of a second OEM partner on Argo’s business. This included research and modeling of market and operating assumptions both in the US and Europe. Through my work on researching potential OEM #2 operations in Europe, I have started developing an expertise in the European TaaS landscape, including market and regulatory dynamics. Our updated P&L assumptions have been reviewed by a group of executives at Ford (“the Magic 4”) and will be presented to Argo’s Board of Directors in June. These Business Plan updates are highly impactful to Argo, as they enable us to unlock our next tranche of funding from Ford. In working on this project, I have received positive feedback from Cynthia, Ming, and Rob on this effort, noting my contribution in helping to drive these updates.",,,Israel Marc Kositsky,ikositsky@argo.ai,Israel Marc Kositsky,ikositsky@argo.ai,General & Administrative,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"**_Fostering Functional & Technical Excellence_**

•	Israel has been highly effective and instrumental in working with internal Argo teams (e.g. Hardware & Software R&D, Systems) to understand key engineering challenges, technical and operating requirements associated with the Argo TaaS business with Ford.  Israel continually exhibits exceedingly high levels of performance and has a strong passion for learning about key technical and operating challenges involved in “what it takes” to develop a self-driving car system. 

•	In studying new business opportunities (e.g. Goods Delivery and OEM#2), Israel has taken on a primary role in studying market sizing assumptions, leading research initiatives to define and study available market data to complete in-depth analysis and provide recommendations on operating and financial assumptions.  Israel has often provided sound judgment and strategic analysis in forming key market assumptions (for purposes of financial modeling), supported and confirmed by multiple sources of research, maintaining a factual, unbiased position that provides for a healthy balance between aggressive and conservative points of view.

•	Additionally, Israel has developed a strong strategic knowledge base of the automotive OEM marketplace, exhibiting an impressive and thorough understanding of key business economic drivers, market competition, and historical trends.  As evidenced in his weekly news updates, Israel continuously monitors industry events and news related to all things self-driving cars and provides insightful analysis. 

**_Collaboration / Communication / Leadership_**

•	We have met several times with key members of Argo’s leadership teams (Brett Browning, Matt Powers, Wes Ford) and Israel has successfully taken on the role as lead facilitator, creating productive discussions around future business opportunities.  He has been essential in building consensus, bring together working teams to agree on operating assumptions required for new business opportunities, which is very challenging to complete when others may not see this as part of their top priority.  More importantly, Israel has been deliberate and effective in gaining critical feedback necessary that impacts operational and financial analysis involved in the strategic decision-making process.  

•	Israel continues to improve his communication (both written / verbal) skills and does an excellent job communicating and working with highly complex and debatable topics, keeping things simple and easy to understand.

•	Israel, in his daily interactions with others, contributes toward embracing a fun working environment while creating a strong culture that is very much objective and results driven, but not at the cost of others.  His relationship management ""soft skills"" and ""can-do"" working attitude contributes to an overall positive and pleasant workplace environment.  

•	With the recent on-boarding of a new business analyst (Nancy), Israel has taken on greater responsibilities to teach and mentor Nancy.  He has been very effective in delegating business development and research assignments, providing support to bring her up to speed with present Argo strategic initiatives, which has resulted into bringing on another strong contributor to the team (i.e. creating effective presentation materials for management teams and providing analytical insights as part of AV market and transportation studies.

**_Objective & Results-Driven_**

•	Israel has displayed sustained high levels of performance through periods of intense and what may be perceived or considered ‘stressful’ situations, often meeting critical deadlines with continued and unwavering support.  Israel has diligently pushed through on a number of assignments (including most recently Argo Ford TaaS Market Sizing assumptions) to thoroughly research and test business model assumptions, whether operating or financial, contributing to high quality work outputs.  Resulting work has often led to influence strategic decision-making with respect to key strategic initiatives with senior management.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"During the previous review cycle, I set out to grow by increasing ownership of projects I worked on, building deeper industry expertise, and establishing relationships with external partners. Since that time, I have made meaningful progress in accomplishing these goals. I took ownership and led Beach-Head City #2 selection and played an instrumental role in driving OEM #2 prioritization, Goods Delivery, and our first Perf cycle. I furthered my industry domain expertise across the AV industry, automotive OEMs, goods delivery, and ridesharing. Lastly, I established relationships with several potential partners, including DiDi. 

As I look ahead over the coming months, I would like to grow and improve in the following areas:
- Continue growth in partnerships – Learn more about commercial terms, how agreements are structured, and key points in negotiating various partnership structures. Cynthia has a wealth of information and expertise in this area, and I hope to learn more from her over the coming months.
- Continue to learn more about international markets, such as Europe and China – As Argo begins thinking about international expansion, it will be important to have a strong understanding of the dynamics, opportunities, and challenges in these markets.  
- Continue to build on technical knowledge of various AV systems – Since the previous review cycle, I have successfully improved on this area and aim to continue building a stronger technical understanding of our VDS.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"My first priority project was the laser transmitter for ARGO LIDAR. 
I took part in opto-mechanical design of whole LIDAR too. 
I took part in thermal design.

During the period our team developed: 
New design of the serial laser bar and 
Laser driver for serial laser bar. 

My main contribution was 
concept, 
schematic, 
routing PCB
measuring of performance
for three different prototypes of laser drivers.

I participate in mechanical, thermal and optical design the LIDAR, for instant I suggest side cooling for the unit. 
I helped other team to understand possible thermal solutions, for instance I made a presentation how to calculate the efficiency of the Thermal Electric Cooler, and presented it for Dustin Yautz and Bilge Kocer Yumer.
I worked with our new employee Mingxiao Yang to help him to start smoothly. Especially we worked on the aliment station for laser bar micro optics. I helped him with Solidworks and control of the 6 axis stage for optical adjustment.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Jack contributed to the development of the Argo Lidar transmitter, including the laser, driver, and packaging, which encompass engineering disciplines related to electronic, optical, mechanical, and thermal design.  His name is quite fitting, as he is literally a 'Jack' of all trades and factotum within the Argo lidar team.  He is a genius, certainly, and has been a significant contributor to virtually every aspect of lidar system development within our organization.  We would not be where we are today without his insight, hard work, and late nights at the office (which sometimes shift into early mornings).  I worked less with Jack in the last 6 months than I typically had in the previous four years, so it is difficult for me to speak about the details of his work in recent months, but I have no reason to believe that the quantity or quality of his work is any less prolific than it was in the past -- even though he'll usually tell you, ""it's pretty easy really!"".  His ability to get work done quickly, with minimal oversight, from such a wide variety of engineering disciplines, is a valuable addition to any R&D team.  Jack is easy to work with, and willing to share ideas, information, and explanations of difficult concepts.  

Overall performance score is very difficult for me to mark because his level of staff engineer is quite high within our organization.  To say that he's a 3, ""ready for promotion to senior staff engineer in the next year"" is a stretch considering how rare this level is within Argo's organization and due to their demanding requirements.  To say that he is a 2, ""solid performer at [staff engineer]"", as defined in the Argo performance review spec is probably pretty accurate.",,,Sam Wilton,swilton@argo.ai,Jack Kotelnikov,jkotelnikov@argo.ai,Hardware,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"For the review period I have been ""2 days a week"" at Argo. I break down my contributions into subcategories below:

Recruiting and technical guidance: During this period the staff scientists have been involved in significant recruiting. I think we helped convince Ersin Yumer and Peter Carr to join Argo, and they look to be fantastic leads for the detection, tracking, and prediction efforts. Peter and Ersin will be collaborating with the staff scientists to advise summer interns on research projects. I have met regularly with Ersin and Peter to discuss their teams' work and offer guidance. I have also spent a lot of time recruiting for the geometric computer vision lead, and hopefully we have as much success there as we've had with Ersin and Peter.

Mapping and labeling: Among the staff scientists, I am tasked with staying abreast of the work done by Tyler's team including SAIPS. In the last two months I have made an effort to attend the three weekly syncs for mapping, labeling, and SAIPS. I also meet with Andy and sometimes Etienne concerning data annotation and active learning.

Misc engineering guidance: I meet with other engineers or perception leads (Kyoung Min, Jingdan, Mike Happold, Josh, etc) to discuss their projects.

Intern research: Approximately 10 research interns will arrive in mid may, and together with Simon and Deva I have helped formulate a project for each of them. These projects will ideally be suitable for publication in a venue like CVPR and potentially impactful to Argo. I interviewed most of the intern candidates to help build our intern cohort. In particular, I have taken the lead on the ""Kitti++"" project. That project will have (at least) two interns, but this entire review period the staff scientists + Ersin + Peter (and occasionally Mike) have met regularly to discuss the project and make sure there are no legal and logistical hurdles for the summer and beyond.

White paper on Miles, Data, and Safety: I have written and am currently expanding a white paper on how Argo will validate the safety of our system. One goal is to develop a target in terms of training data and miles driven, but more broadly we want to be able to verify the system as a whole and each subsystem is as safe as possible, and in the worst case fails gracefully and safely.",,,James Hays,jhays@argo.ai,James Hays,jhays@argo.ai,Software,

His contributions on the hiring side helping us find talent (including myself ;) ) are undeniable. 

On a technical level, I do respect James's ideas quite a lot. He is someone who doesn't talk a lot in a meeting for instance, but when he says something I know that there are gems in the comment.

James's help with sketching out and planning the upcoming intern projects have been quite substantial. I look forward to the intern projects where some of the end results might leap Argo in front of the state of the art in perception.

James has also been very helpful with his feedback on some of the designs we have solidified for our perception stack during my short time at Argo. I am sure the scientist hat he is wearing with the mapping and labeling team will also pay off in Q3/18 and beyond. ",,,Ersin Yumer,eyumer@argo.ai,James Hays,jhays@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"With the arrival of Peter Carr and Ersin Yumer, I have greatly enjoyed the discussions we have on their projects. But I have become a bit more disconnected from the work of individual engineers (partly because Peter and Ersin need less help than Guillaume and Rob needed). I should reach out more to the entire teams.

I have tried to become knowledgable about labeling and mapping (Tyler's team), but I don't think I've had impact in that space yet, because there hasn't been as much need for automation or active learning, yet. But there will be more of this. I need to be more familiar with the actual tools and annotation pipeline.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Since joining Argo in July, I have been in a role on the infrastructure, release and deployment team that has allowed me to utilize my deep experience with CI systems and also my extensive development experience.  The first major project that I tackled was migrating our continuous integration system from a hosted TravisCI to our own hosted instance of Jenkins CI.  Not only was the initial project a challenging effort, but since that time, the organization and the code base has grown, along with the pace of development.  Keeping the organization’s continuous integration system running fast and efficiently could be a full time job for a team of individuals, which I have done in addition to being able to contribute to different areas including working on the design and implementation of the AV integration and regression framework, along with many other tools and services that the development organization relies upon. 

One of the most interesting aspects of my role and team with Argo is that we operate like a central development team that is focused on infrastructure projects to drive and support the AV codebase and many other projects. We also are like an operations team in which we support the organization with services and support and help which make our team very different.  This unique role is also a very challenging role because we are expected to maintain large systems and services that the development organization depends upon to do their daily work, much like that of an IT role, but we still have projects that we need to also deliver on a standard candace.  This is a very unique opportunity and one that I feel I strive in, as I balance maintaining our systems and processes and still being able to contribute to software projects that benefit the organization, like the build queue.  I feel that I am a perfect fit for our team by having a great deal of expertise with CI and build systems and also having the software engineering background that helps me to understand the workflows and systems that I need to build and to also have the technical skills to deliver upon.  My role requires an array of knowledge that spans from operating systems, cloud services, CI systems and concepts, IT knowledge to programming and debugging.  On any given day I may find myself writing CI code in Groovy, extending deployment and build logic code in Python, to debugging and developing C++ code for something like the integration framework.  It's really a unique role that requires the navigation between so many different programming languages, technical skills, and platforms, but I feel that I am able to excel at that challenge based on my success so far.  If that wasn’t enough of a technical base to have to navigate, our team and CI systems have to support other teams that work with web technologies, orchestration, and microservices that require knowledge and support of programming languages that range from Java to JavaScript.

Diving into the details on one of my biggest responsibilities and contributions is managing, designing, implementing, and maintaining our main development continuous integration system.  After I had finished designing and implementing the initial setup of our Jenkins CI system, I knew that the system would have to continue to grow and evolve and so far that has held true.  At the time of my initial work on migrating our CI system I was essentially the only developer working on this project.  I was responsible for all aspects of setting up the new CI system which included configuring AWS, setting up Jenkins, and actually migrating the CI process.  A project at this scale, complexity, and importances, would obviously need to be done by someone with a much experience and expertise or even a whole team, but I was able to complete the project as one example of how I have been continuously delivering above my level on not only the technical level, but also as a leader who has delivered a system that impacts the organization by being at the core of the development process.  I was trusted to solely setup and manage  the CI system for months before getting support with adding a new member to the team.
 
An early design decision that I made was to utilize a capability in Jenkins that allows for dynamic provisioning of EC2 instances in AWS, that has allowed the system to scale with the organization.  A typical CI setup for most companies is to utilize a set number of static workers, but I knew that a solution like that wouldn’t scale.  Using the EC2 provisioning capabilities, I was able to implement what has grown into a considerably large and complex CI library or better known as a Jenkins pipeline that is built and coded to take advantage of the EC2 dynamic provisioning and scalability.  I am called upon to routinely be able to diagnose issues that arise in the CI system which can happen because of the numerous moving parts in the system and all of the integration points.  In our CI system, we are dependent upon the Jenkins master node being set up and tuned to run on the JVM within Docker inside of an EC2 instance.  There are many points of failure just on that single node and that is magnified if you take disaster recovery and security also in account.  Our system is also dependent on AWS, GitHub, DockerHub and many other smaller services and systems.  Debugging, configuring, and tuning a complex system like ours is extremely challenging and also extremely rewarding.  I know that the team and organization is dependent upon me to provide a stable environment and to minimize disruptions to the organization, which I think that I have done along with help from the rest of my team.

The pipeline code is written in Apache Groovy, which is a language built on top of the Java VM and is typically utilized as a scripting and DSL language, which Jenkins utilizes.  I was able to build up a comprehensive library that is used across all jobs including AV and mapping/labeling builds using my extensive knowledge of CI systems and my development background.  The library provides all of the logic to drive the AV builds which includes encapsulation of git operations, docker, AWS, file system, Artifactory and many other common utilities.  Jenkins and the Groovy DSL can be very challenging to work with given that it's not easy to architect, code, and debug within a system that integrates into this large system and is responsible for interacting with many other external tools such as compilers, source control, and even our own scripts.  The skills that I demonstrate in this are is being able to understand how the Jenkins CI system works, from how it interacts with AWS and launches EC2 instances and being able to not only setup and configure the system, but also write the DSL code that then drives the system.

Recently, as the team has grown, we have added many projects and teams that operate outside of the core AV code base.  This would include teams such as labeling, mapping, and offboard.  These team all have unique requirements for CI and deployment systems that differ greatly in ways from the AV system.  Part of my role on the team is ensuring that I can provide support for these teams to be able to utilize our continuous integration system.  This support can range from setting up projects to writing builds scripts.  I recently finished a project that involved designing and implementing the initial CI process for the offboard team.  This was a challenging CI project because of the diversity in projects and technologies that the offboard projects bring in, and the included complex dependencies.  The offboard projects have dependencies on the AV build, so I needed to figure out how to package those dependencies from within the AV CI process.  This was done by extending our image creation code that is responsible for building docker images to build up and publish a special offboard docker image that could later be consumed by a downstream build and deployment process. I also authored the core Offboard CI process which entailed setting up project in Jenkins, writing the main build scripts that had to be able to build and test python projects, publish python packages to Artifactory, and run Java Gradle builds.  I was able to write new code to support running builds on the Gradle build system to support this effort along with utilizing the existing pipeline code to reduce duplication and ease maintenance of our CI builds scripts.  After the initial work on the Offboard project, I was able to transition the maintenance over to that team where they could easily extend and modify the process as their projects grow and evolve.  As the system continues to expand with the organization,  the organizational impact is obvious in that the CI system and the solid base and architecture that I have put into place has allowed the system to scale to other teams working on areas that have very different needs than that of the AV code base. 

Expanding on the last section, much of my work involves design and implementation of complex systems including CI build scripts, complicated testing pipelines, and items like release and deployment.  I was able to help architect and guide many of the labeling and mapping projects and support the teams with CI when needed.  For the mapping team, I was again able to architect and develop a base system that I could then hand over and act as resource for reviews and guidance, but allowing the team to still have the freedom to modify the CI process to fit their workflow.  Being able to design and then guid other teams in this area is critical as it empowers development teams to own much of their process and to also free myself and my team up to work on other critical needs.  I believe that I am a subject matter expert in CI, software engineering concepts, and CI system like Jenkins and that I am able to mentor and provide support to other teams to help to deliver their software now and to also provide a path to building upon best practices with build, test, deployment, and general software.  Again, I have demonstrated leadership skills and knowledge levels much above that of my current level over the course of my tenure based upon the support and knowledge that I have demonstrated with providing CI support to other teams, like the Maprep and Offboard teams.

Given the service oriented nature of my role and of my team, organization OKR’s along with our team goals are always a focus in my work.  As the teams and codebase continue to grow, my team and I are challenged with continually having to improve and refine our CI and build scripts as an example, in order to keep up with the demand and to provide an exceptional quality of service.  There were many factors in the AV codebase that started to lead to slower build and CI times including growth of the system.  With the growth we found that we had to disable some of the quality gating mechanisms that we had in place on pull requests or to limit the scope of those in order to have CI runs finish in an acceptable amount of time.  While we were able to reduce some of the time for a code change to be integrated into the mainline, we were also missing some unit test failures that had to be tracked down daily.  Tracking down unit test failures was a very time consuming duty that I took on for some time until the CI Task force was created.  I was primarily in charge of monitoring the task force where I had to log Jira tickets and dispatch those to other volunteer members of the task force.  While this effort demonstrated my leadership and multi-tasking skills along with drive for quality, I felt that we needed to speed up our CI pipeline and also reinstate our quality gates to achieve many of our organizational OKR’s and to also free up myself and other to work on more impactful projects.   

I started testing a product called IncrediBuild in our system on and off through my tenure here at Argo.  IncrediBuild is a product that I used in my past in order to distribute tasks and speed up the build and CI pipeline.  I worked several months on planning, debugging, and incorporating IncrediBuild into our AV build process as I saw many possibilities with utilizing a distributed system in our development and CI process.  There were multiple issues and bugs that I uncovered in which I had to work with the IncrediBuild developers and tech support to resolve.  I also had to develop a rollout plan for integrating the system in CI and development along with staging the infrastructure necessary for IncrediBuild, which included setting up coordinator instances in AWS, extending the AV build process to invoke the IncrediBuild process within our existing scripts, and adding support in our CI system.  

After testing and prototyping out the system, the results were very promising, so the next step was to present a design review and move forward with the system rollout.  After rolling out IncrediBuild to the organization, we started to see local build and CI times reduced greatly.  After working through some initial issues with the system, the team and myself aggressively worked to optimize the build system and to eliminate all test failures in our AV sanitizer tests.  We were able to get to a point where we had a fast build and CI system in place with limited test failures and that led us to enabling the pull request quality gates that would run the sanitizers again for each code changeset.  Not only did this work lead to turning on the quality gates, but were were able to turn on the sanitizer unit testing to run all of the tests in each pull request instead of running on only the impacted items.  This ensures that we are covering all parts of the system and we were able to achieve all of this at a much faster rate then the old system could.  This effort led us to helping the organization in achieving success on OKR’s that impacted quality of the code, the development process, CI success, along with many other positives.  While I had a great impact on this, my team helped to support the idea and contributed greatly to many areas that helped us to reach many of our team OKR’s.

While this work has led to many positives there was still room for improvements.  The team continued to make optimizations in many of our build scripts and tools in order to speed up our CI build times.  I was able to investigate performance bottlenecks in our AWS environment and found that the instance type and disk type that we were using were hampering our build times.  I was able to come up with an EC2 configuration that utilized much faster disks and removed many of the bottlenecks that CI builds were experiencing.   I was able to extend my automated AMI creation process to support the new instance type and mount the ephemeral disk on startup while still integrating in our dynamically provisioned Jenkins system.  Along with that change, I made it easier to pull the latest argobuild docker image into the AMI, and thus reduce latency in the system where every CI build would have to pull down Gigabytes of data that now is built into the AMI.  I also extended the Jenkins CI process to startup the required EC2 instances in parallel to other steps to take additional time out of the CI process.  These changes, along with contributions from the rest of the team allowed us to reduce our average CI time for AV builds from thirty to sixty minutes dow to ten to twenty minutes.  This effort allows us to integrate on average, four pull requests per an hour versus two.

In addition to managing the CI process for the company and working on team projects, I support many other efforts and services.  I maintain and manage our Artifactory repository which involves general administration and guidance on project setup and training. I help with Github and Docker Hub administration and maintenance.  I have also been involved with ongoing meetings with various teams to support testing efforts and software engineering standards.  I have begun to meet with the embedded team in order to work with them to bring their development process inline with the rest of the organization in terms of coding standards, CI, testing, and the use of Artifactory to version their assets. I have contributed greatly to the design and coding of the AV integration and regression framework for C++ and Python.  This entailed working on a design that would allow integration tests to be authored and provide framework support for general testing needs including running, retrieving large datasets from Artifactory and test reporting.  I also wrote much of the initial C++ code for the integration Framework.  I routinely hold training sessions of various aspects of our CI system to other teams and give a training session every week to initiate new team members to our development and testing process at Argo.  I also contribute to many other projects such as our build queue in Argobot and am involved with introducing a new design along coding it to handle our workload more efficiently.

I believe that I have added value to company in all of the areas that I touch and that I have been involved with in my time here at Argo.  I bring a great deal of experience with seventeen years of professional development and a different view in some instances .  While I have an expertise in continuous integration and devops, I also bring in a lot of software development experience and believe that I am in a sort of unique position.  In many cases over the last nine months I have been the sole developer responsible for design, implementation, and support at least until the team has started to build up recently.  I believe that this fact demonstrates that I can be counted on to deliver high quality systems and code.  I enjoy being the go to person for many different areas, but especially devops and continuous integration related items and am always here to support the team and my co-workers.  I love working on my team and being challenged with unique and large problems. I believe that my decisions, designs, and recommendations are well thought out and based on experience, knowledge, and best practices as I have demonstrated in my work.  I am able to work independently, mentor co-workers, and seek input from my team when necessary.  I exhibit outstanding skills even in difficult and demanding situations which I have demonstrated over the course of the last nine months with supporting a growing organization that has high demands and load on my CI system. I am very responsive to other developers and teams and am always willing to answer questions and to provide support.   I have worked hard and am willing to continue doing so on the many future projects that come my way, while continuing to support our daily development process with CI, testing, and release activities.  

I believe that I have presented a strong case for my promotion.  I was given the responsibility and workload of what a senior or tech lead at most companies would be in charge of, even without the support of a team for a large portion of my tenure here, I was able to deliver on all of my projects and even add additional value and services given how thin I have been stretched at times over the last year.  I feel that I have earned the trust and respect of my colleagues and leaders of the company have come to me multiple times with requests and to get input and help from me.  I have a solid background as a software engineer where I have worked on comlex build systems, written test frameworks, worked as a senior middle tier and front end engineer as well as leading a team as a tech lead.  I am passionate about CI and infrastructure work and believe that it is critical for a company's success.  I will continue to support the infrastructure needs of the company at a high level and look forward to the many challenges ahead as we continue to grow and morph as an engineering organization.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Generally, my interactions with Jason revolve around the CI system.  If something breaks, I usually talk to him (or TR) and they generally get things fixed up promptly.

For what it's worth, I also consider Jason to be a fun and responsive guy to work with.

Beyond this, I'm not sure that I have a lot of constructive feedback that I can give.  I don't have a lot of visibility into his code (I'm not the primary reviewer or anything) and the code is also generally outside of my area of expertise (Their team works a lot more with Docker and Jenkins/Groovy related technology than I'm used to) so it's hard for me to objectively evaluate some of the stuff that they've done.

I _do_ think that there are areas of improvement in some of the infrastructure code that I've seen (more consistent use of loggers would be great) but I don't know how much of that is Jason's department vs. other people.

With all of that said, I'm surprised to see Jason listed as a SWE 1 here.  If that is accurate, then I think he has an incredible amount of responsibility for someone of that level.",,,Matt Gilson,mgilson@argo.ai,Jason McFall,jmcfall@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Jason is a critical engineer within our company. Drawing from years of industry experience Jason often has intuition related to CI that saves us countless hours and dollars.

In terms of using AWS and Jenkins, Jason continuously astounds me at his ability to organize and manage the very complex machine that is our CI. This complexity comes from the breadth of the problem which is ensuring that all of our PRs have machines available so that our code builds in  a timely manner. There are many things that developers can do to reduce the load on our CI, but Jason goes the extra mile to support engineers so they can leverage our CI and place their focus on their unique problems.

During this cycle,Jason rolled out incredibuild, which has greatly reduced our build times. He has enabled and continues to enforce multiple sanitizers that maintain our code health. Most notably, Jason continuously researches and presents new alternatives that can improve our CI such as using memory based AWS instances for our builds since persistence was unnecessary, or examining alternative merge queues.

Jason often comes to meetings with new ideas and suggestions related to CI, he is literally one of the guiding forces of our CI infrastructure.",,,Constantin Savtchenko,csavtchenko@argo.ai,Jason McFall,jmcfall@argo.ai,Software,

This involves not only keeping the current system running, but handles scaling these systems at the speed of Argo. The scale, complexity, and growth of this system is substantially larger than a typical technical project.
* Balances the demands of keeping a mission critical system functioning with actively developing new features. CI is in a unique position in that it must operate constantly and without long term outages, but also has to implement new features and capabilities (both inside and outside the CI system). This requires a very difficult balance between these two roles, and Jason has done well to strike that balance.
* Has demonstrated the ability to collaborate with a large number of people in running the CI Task Force when trying to re-enable quality gates, and was able to recruit volunteers and successfully organize them to track down issues.

The work in improving the build and testing scripts and introducing unit tests and quality gates can be applied elsewhere (e.g. image generation/deployment), and Jason is in a unique position to lead transferring this knowledge between domains.
* Helping to push for more prototyping and design documentation to guide making technical selections. Interactions between Incredibuild and modern build systems required making a mutual choice, and having concrete evidence to justify the decision would help when communicating with other team members and minimizing the amount of second guessing that could occur.
* Working to identify how to improve the bus factor of the CI system.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Again, without a lot of visibility it's hard to give a good answer.  A few things that come to mind:

* I think that the artifactory credential process is really weird -- That might not be something under Jason's control but it'd be great if we could do something less insane than log in to a site and then ping Jason asking for access (why can't we get access before logging in?)
* I think Jason is correct that getting better at Python would be really helpful in multiple areas.  For one, it'll help for getting stuff done since Python is the lingua-fraca for most of the ""do stuff"" scripts we have floating around.  Second, learning how the entire python ecosystem works and working with different virtual environments would be really beneficial.  We're sort of at an awkward place with our org wanting to be python3.6+ but our ubuntu version doesn't support that OOB which leads to some tension between software and IT.  The more that Jason and the Infrastructure team know about this stuff, the better job we can do of making this work more streamlined for everyone.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"It has been a crazy ride since starting at Argo in late January. Two and one half days into my career at Argo I was asked if I would be willing to change my IC role into a team lead role. I happily accepted and since then have embarked on a fast paced, challenging, and exciting journey. 

I have been informed that my situation is more unique than others and that being the case was advised to show multiple levels of work and capability. I will demonstrate that I have been working and delivering at levels up to and including level 8 on a consistent basis. 

Management Scope
I am responsible for the establishment and development of a newer team for Argo. This team currently consists of five direct reports that were established prior to my taking the position. A sixth member was recently hired and will be starting soon. I am working to further define the role and responsibilities of a TPM at Argo, clarifying how TPMs interact with TLs and their teams and empowering them to influence and in some cases make decisions on team performance and deliverables. This speaks to the Knowledge/Expertise/Business Acumen description of a level 7. With regards to the team itself, I have been mentoring a team of individuals with varying levels of experience and varying types of experience. The team is mostly LV5s but come from backgrounds that include automotive, cloud, and defense work. I also hold weekly 1 on 1's with my direct reports to review current status, answer any questions and provide coaching points depending on each ones needs or team situations. This level of interaction is what is expected for someone that is a level 7.

Currently there are 24 software technical teams that are being managed by my group. Of these 24 team I am currently the TPM for 5 of them besides my duties as the lead. Recent events have lead to the discussion of me assigning a new TPM to these teams but two of the tech leads that cover three teams have asked that I continue on as their TPM due to the level of comfort and working relationships that I built with the teams (ML, Tracking, Perception).  Effective management of these teams over multiple disciplines and different projects is the basis for a level 6 contributor.  

Company Process
One of the major roles of my position is to develop process and procedure to better manage teams, efforts, and overall continue to keep the organization moving at high speeds and with accuracy. This speaks directly to the requirements of a level 8. I have demonstrated success in this area through the development of process, procedure and tools for a couple different items. 

First, with the help of my team, implemented a 1 week sprint cadence to help maintain the organizational speed that was generated as a result of Code Red. This was accomplished by the development of leaner, more focused, task tracker (Sprint Tracker 2.0) and a more focused sprint planning schedule . The teams have continued to utilize these practices since the roll out and I continue to monitor and adjust as we go to ensure that we keep the pace up. 
Second, developed an objective weekly update process that includes a simple slide deck and a meeting schedule. This process has been a favorite with teams because they feel like they have a voice and it is being heard. A subset of these weekly updates have also been used to revamp the weekly tech report. It includes the ""Wins for the Week"", ""Current Task Targets"", and ""Stressors"". The new tech report has been praised numerous times by Bryan Salesky. Both the slide deck and tech report provide a new level of visibility into software development that were not there before. 

Third, along with Tom Bloxsom, developed a six week quarter planning process. This process includes the delivery of OKR scoring, new OKR development, Epic Lists and team roadmaps. This process can be found described in the document “Argo AI Guidelines for OKR and Quarter Planning”. This particular document has gotten great feedback from both Bryan Salesky and Peter Rander, “Guys, great doc!  Leaps and bounds ahead of where we were.” It was developed after leading a team of SW TPMs to conduct an intensive 2 week XF Q2 planning session that ended with the successful development of Q2 plans for 24 SW tech teams. 

While we have made some great improvements I am still going to strive to evolve processes and procedures to enable easier cross functional team interaction and to promote more open and accurate communication. One Example is that I am currently working with SW Dev, A&I, Mapping, TestOps and FleetOps to create a more intuitive process and workflow for tickets. I have also Established better lines of communication and also better working relationships with other parts of Argo including HW, Systems, Finances, Recruiting and People Ops. This was done through regular meetings and more open communication.

Project Management
I have shown that I can not only manage a team but can also manage multiple cross functional projects at the same time. These projects have significant impact on the company. This is a core requirement for both levels 6 and 7.

Within the first week I was at Argo, I worked with Randy to develop the framework for incident response process. This included researching work that had already been done from a technical standpoint (bricks, forensics) and then building this work into a team configuration and staffing plan. This process is starting to spin up with expanded FleetOps in Dearborn. 

I Created and kicked off the CI task force. This task force was designed to help the CI team reach their goal of creating a CI environment that is all green"". This process included the cycling of two people from different teams each week to work with the CI team. After about 8 weeks of solid work the team was successful in progressing the CI environment and the newly formed RAD team took over and finished off the assignment. 

I lead a team of TPMs and PMs to create a project plan for Z1 BB/SB Bringup that was more realistic of the tasking, resources, and time lines than what was initially shown. This included guiding the TPM teams in calling XF team meetings to discuss scope and loading, performing risk analysis based on loading, HW deliverables, and other outside influencers. This also included performing risk mitigation and critical path analysis. 

Another program management function was to lead six software tech teams in the planning of Q2 activities that included the development of a team roadmap, schedule, and also setting expectations for what work could be completed in the time frame. This immediately evolved into 
aiding in the execution of the Q2 plans by keeping teams on  schedule, re-planning when needed, removing blockers and predicting potential trouble spots. 

Experience Added
I have been able to start to demonstrate my expertise and judgement, described in levels 6,7, and 8,  in this position utilizing my experience. I am able to analyze team and IC health both performance wise and psychologically based on team performance and mannerisms. I have also been both asked and have taken the initiative to deep dive with different SW dev teams, depending on the need to coach both the TL and ICs on project planning and resource 
management. In a couple cases I have been asked by both TLs and Execs for my opinions and guidance on how to deal with challenging personnel/team issues that have come up. Finally, I have also worked with People Ops and Finances team to help stabilize the hiring plan and help to define team needs.

In my short time here at Argo I believe that I have made a significant impact on the organization through my project management experience, establishment of newer processes and team management skills. I can also say that I have learned more in this short amount of time than I have with any other organization both technically and personally. I am looking forward to the future and will continue to invent, evolve, and lead procedures and practices to advance argo as a company and to educate its employees.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,report,"Jason has been an excellent leadership force in establishing structure and consistency in project planning at Argo, and in shifting the culture to accept and embrace new thinking in these areas.

- Roll out of quarterly planning process, getting everyone thinking about upcoming work in the same cadence, driving consistency in reporting, reviewing, and messaging work deliverables, making it easy for others to see the expected outcome of any team.

- Driving a process to highlight wins and challenges from the team.  Getting exec buy-in on the format and presentation of the data, and using it to drive meaningful discussions about stressors, areas to improve, and priorities.  This has led to lots of great discussion that wouldn't have otherwise happened.

- Improving usage of Jira, so that teams more consistently track and describe work items, making it easier to find details of work and to submit requests.

- Jason has also made good strides in incorporating the many varied opinions of stakeholders, engineering teams, and TPMs to build towards a shared goal and address different points of view.

- Jason has also been great at supporting me and my teams through any tricky situations and providing advice on how to maintain momentum on projects when things are stalling.",,,Randy Schultheis,rschultheis@argo.ai,Jason Mizgorski,jmizgorski@argo.ai,Software,

- Drove the Q1 OKR grading process",,,Michael Riley,mriley@argo.ai,Jason Mizgorski,jmizgorski@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,report,"Jason has been a force multiplier for the SW-TPM team.  As the lead for the SW-TPM team Jason has been able to take the ideas from the SW-TPMs and the requests from the executive team and blend those into a set of documents that satisfies the needs of both parties.  This was not an easy process as there are strong opinions on both sides, but Jason was able to sell and defend his approach throughout the process.  We are now getting to a state where we have a manageable number of docs to update, that tell the software story, and allow the ability to quickly replan and determine the effects of slip.  This is no small feat and has been a huge benefit to the organization.

Additionally Jason has been a mentor to the SW-TPMs.  There have been a couple times when I needed help on an approach for a situation with another TPM or Team Lead, and Jason was my go to person to get advice.  Jason will take the time to listen to the situation, understand your perspective, and then give his perspective and advice or step in to help when necessary.  This mentorship, and leadership, has really improved the SW-TPM team as a whole.

In addition to his responsibilities as the SW-TPM lead, Jason still has responsibility as a TPM for a handful of perception teams.

The feedback you provide management has really helped target my efforts to meet their needs and prioritize my time.

I appreciate the reminder on what's due when and your flexibility when Extra time is needed.  With all the various tasks we have you make sure we're keeping the right people happy.

You're helping shape and improve the interactions between the various TPM teams.  You've been very good at Identifying the areas where roles, responsibilities and communication can improve and how to elicit more from other teams.

His arrival was coupled with an 2x increase in the SW-TPM team, code red, and our first real fleet operations with Autonomous Vehicles. Jason managed the team, risk, and turning chaos into order in the short amount of time he's been at Argo.

Jason drove the recent updates to reporting, organization, and weekly cadence within the TPM team. New sprint trackers, quarterly roadmaps, OKR planning schedules, and other process documents have made a significant impact on planning, and thus overall velocity on the SW team.

I'm certain that Jason is fighting many battles with upper-management and his peers. However, he keeps pushing for some changes on behalf of the team. Jason is a great TPM and a great supervisor.",,,Ryan Morton,rmorton@argo.ai,Jason Mizgorski,jmizgorski@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Jason is contributing at multiple levels. He:
(1) leads the TPM team, 
(2) assumes the TPM role for my team and some others in Perception, due to a missing TPM IC,
(3) drives the Autonomy integration related tracking: feature integration and blocker elimination.

In all there categories, he has excelled and consistently delivered beyond expectations. To be clear, his job either should be 1+3, or just 2. But he did all three without complaints and putting in the extra time. Being me -- the 24 hour online person, I have always been able to reach out to Jason when I needed him. 

I am a fan of open, transparent tracking of work, and Jason definitely helped me achieve this as a team lead. He replanned Jira boards, worked with ICs to bring them up to speed on how to use Jira correctly, helped me prepare the weekly update slides, and keep sprint tracker up to date. 

He helped our team communicate with other teams to unblock labeling, and infrastructure related problems. 

Jason is delivering consistently above his level. His understanding of the role and help he should provide at Argo is beyond other TPMs I have interacted with. He works with people at many levels -- from ICs to execs, without a glimpse of struggle in the context switch. ",,,Ersin Yumer,eyumer@argo.ai,Jason Mizgorski,jmizgorski@argo.ai,Software,

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"An area that I would like to continue to grow in is my systems knowledge of the AV and its support infrastructure. While I have learned a lot in my short time here at Argo I believe I will be a more effective Lead TPM/TPM if I deepen my understanding of the system. I am looking to schedule more time on the car and also spending some more time learning about the ""day in the life"" of team members in all tech areas. 

One aspect of myself as a Lead TPM that I would like to improve on is my time management. While I have been able to meet deadlines and keep pace I feel it has come at a cost of not allowing the proper amount of time to interact with my direct reports and SW teams. I believe I can improve this by more careful planning and also taking another look at some processes to see if they can be simplified or made more impactful.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,report,"One area of improvement could be in the rollout of new policies and procedures.  This would help me learn about a process, provide feedback, and implement it with my teams.  For example, when sprint metrics or weekly report slides were established, the docs were generated and deployed rapidly without thorough explanation of the sections within or the aims of the doc.  I was unaware of the details of the sprint capacity calculations, such as how they were derived and who was using them.  I felt similarly unclear about some sections of the WR slides, such as the health grid and team loading, while it was starting to be deployed.  A good improvement here would be to have a formal announcement of a new doc or process (email or meeting), with an explanation of the contents and process, collect feedback, and then formally deploy.

Another area of improvement would be in the collection of feedback and in the dissemination of information and goals from upper management.  Some policies or procedures are implemented due to an outside ask but without a deeper dive on the ""why"" or what problem we're trying to solve.  A more thorough overview of this before rolling out a new process would help clarify aims to the teams and provide opportunities to make it even better with a fuller understanding of the need.  Similarly, it feels difficult to transmit a suggestion upward as it tends to get lost in the shuffle of external and upper management requests.  We should try to validate, test, and broadcast suggestions evenly from all parts of the org, so that the best ideas can be heard and incorporated.",,,Randy Schultheis,rschultheis@argo.ai,Jason Mizgorski,jmizgorski@argo.ai,Software,

- Can be difficult to get a hold of for clarification on tasks
- Largely out of the loop on my day-to-day work, challenges, and successes

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,report,"We generally have very productive 1-on-1 sessions weekly, or at least every other week. I'd benefit more if these meetings were either a little more structured (e.g., start by listing the agenda topics) or contained more of a focus on non-current issues. During these 1-1s we're often just discussing the topics of the day, vs career development, mentoring, and other high-value (long-term) usage of our time. These 1-1s would be even better if we added this minor tweak, which would pay dividends in the end.

Jason has been with Argo a very short amount of time, but overall he's done a fabulous job. There have been just a few confusing times when we didn't agree, among SW-TPM team, on who was taking charge of various aspects of a project. For example, often there are 2x TPMs co-leading a project, but it wasn't make clear that they're both owning or if one should step up with the other taking a back-up role. This is likely a startup-transient, but it's a potential area for improvement.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"I have consistently taken on and successfully delivered on critical path projects during this review period, contributing substantially to efforts across a broad range of teams. My work has demonstrated immediate high impact and broad influence across the entire system. Key examples of my impact as an individual contributor include my contributions in delivering the localization system, my efforts supporting and eventually rewriting the LiDAR pipeline, and leaning in on issues impacting system performance including helping with infrastructure, build, and deployment concerns.

My first assignment at Argo had me stepping into the Localization team, involved in developing and landing the initial cut of on vehicle localization in Q42017. This work required focused, tight collaboration among a half dozen team members in order to deliver new pose estimation which feeds almost every on board subsystem, with sufficient time to test and integrate to meet the 3500 miles/week OKR. I was personally responsible for the interface to expose the localization prior to the scan matching system, the initial Applanix-based bootstrapping framework, parts of the initial scan matching performance tooling, and integrating the scan matcher into the localization framework, as well as taking a large part of testing and delivery of the initial localization system. This project gave me a chance to demonstrate my ability to work within a team to decompose a large, mission-critical problem into small chunks, and help guide the design of components to help mitigate integration pains and provide robustness in the design against future feature development. The LocalMapInterface, for instance, was originally specified as an interface which would only operate for a relatively short window of time (on the order of a month or two), but has served for over half a year with minimal interface modifications. The development of the localization system also required coordinating delivery, integration, and transition without significant negative impact on customers, in a timely fashion when under a tight deadline. Furthermore, the development of this system introduced little unplanned technical debt, with the localization code operating without major bug fixes or unanticipated refactoring required.

Another substantial effort I participated in was evaluating, improving, and eventually completely rewriting of the core on-vehicle LiDAR pipeline. This work started in parallel with localization efforts, during which I initially implemented several improvements to the LiDAR pipeline to support log playback efforts with LiDAR data. This evolved into an initial evaluation of the code health of the pipeline, in which it was identified that this component was working for the short term, but was a large source of technical debt which would hurt system performance and maintainability over time. Later changes brought these concerns into sharp focus, with changes aimed at optimizing runtime made the pipeline unstable and difficult to debug. This led to five person team coming together to rewrite the pipeline as part of the run up to the 03/29 demo. I acted as the primary contributor (design, implementation, testing, and deployment) to rewriting the driver component, which uses the same amount of computational resources, but validates the structure of received messages, outputs more detailed diagnostics, and processes the positioning data stream from Velodyne sensors. In this work, I introduced a new layer of system validation into the design, which ensures that the hardware and software are correctly configured, detecting several vehicles in the fleet which were misconfigured, as well as introducing several new diagnostics which are important for system health monitoring, such as packet validation and time synchronization status. This design also provided more rigorous design documentation and analysis, including more formal design analysis to provide insight into the trade-offs in the organization and representation of messages in both current and future system details, ensuring that the design not only derives and meets system requirements, but provides the in-depth analysis required for re-visiting these decisions if future work has substantive impact on these concerns. I also was a contributor to the design, implementation, and deployment of the accumulation stage, including guiding other's development. The accumulation stage required careful coordination in order to ensure that the implementation was efficient in a single threaded design (cutting CPU utilization in half compared to the previous implementation and reducing accumulation latency), fixing several long-standing issues (supporting sweep accumulation in log playback, enforcing required latency budgets for the system, providing more in-depth information about the health of the task), but also capable of supporting future implementation of partial sweeps and a lock-free multi-threaded implementation. This required taking a critical component of the system, designing and building a new version from scratch with an eye towards both current requirements and forward-looking issues, as well as testing and deploying without disrupting operations in time critical scenarios.

The work on the LiDAR pipeline redesign also led to follow on work which both shows the quality of work done in the initial deployment, but also speaks to technical leadership. I led expansion of the LiDAR pipeline to support the VLS-128 engineering samples for initial testing. This required working with two other team members to ensure that the changes to the LiDAR pipeline were consistent, clearly documented and communicated for future reference, and minimized technical debt through the process. This process highlights both the initial robustness of the new pipeline design in how easily the pipeline was generalized (~1 week to develop, test, and land software changes adding this support), but ability to step into a leadership role (leading 2 engineers in development effort) when needed.

In addition to working on substantive technical work, I also have taken on a variety of issues and roles outside the normal course of my work, identifying critical concerns in the company where I can make a large impact by volunteering to help out other teams or take on additional roles. One example would be helping improve and coordinate the delivery of software to the system. I volunteered early on to moonlight with the RAD team, providing an MVP implementation of minimal subtree logic in the initial mono-repo transition to help reduce build times, providing features and bug fixes to the merge queue, and eliminating the installation of headers to reduce build times. Additionally, I became a module release master, a reader, and a member of the coding standards committee, as well as being one of the most active saints managing the merge queue, including performing much of the manual management during Code Red and to help land critical PRs for releases. This work demonstrates my ability to identify broad concerns across the software system, handle responsibility in delivering quality software, and working at a variety of levels in ensuring high quality software is delivered.

This ability to have a broad impact on the system also includes a variety of debugging/improvement efforts during the Code Red. This included tracking systemic latency issues in the system down to misconfigured kernel flags, assisting in investigation of camera stability issues, and identifying and fixing limitations in the Pose interface used throughout the system. These issues require subject matter expertise in multiple areas of the system as well as in understanding the system at a larger scale. Additionally, issues such as the Pose interface limitation required developing improvements which address concerns across a wide number of teams without introducing new issues. During Code Red I also identified a fundamental issue in the treatment of time in log playback, discussing it with the vehicle core infrastructure team, and writing up a design document which formed the basis of the eventual fix.

Outside of technical impact, I have also demonstrated superb communication skills, the trust of others when I speak, and a strong grasp of technical details and challenges across the system. A prime example of this is being chosen and performing as one of two co-pilots for the 03/29 demo to Jim Farley and Sherif Marakby. This required demonstrating the ability to safely and reliably operate a vehicle, developing both a broad understanding of the system design, implementation, and alternative potential designs and tradeoffs, as well as the ability to communicate clearly and effectively about the technical and real world challenges faced by the system to people both expert and non-expert individuals while working to safely operate the software side of a vehicle. Beyond simply demonstrating the ability to communicate at this level, selection as one of the two co-pilots given the relatively short amount of time I’ve been with Argo highlights the trust I’ve built within the company to serve in such a role.

I believe I have demonstrated sustained, long term effort and impact in mission critical problems across the system. I have consistently driven features to completion to make delivery schedules; standing up the initial localization system required steady, consistent collaboration, development, and testing to ensure the system had accurate state estimation that impacts much of the on-vehicle software. The LiDAR pipeline work demonstrated my ability to identify areas of concern that stretch across a variety of aspects of system performance, and to work closely with a team in both individual contributor and leadership roles to land complex and critical features. I have proactively identified areas to contribute in reducing technical debt, improving system capability, and working positively with other teams and individuals to produce an impact beyond individual contributions within my current assignment. Code Red and the 3/29 demo required months of 14-18 hour days over 7 working day weeks to drive many of the efforts described previously, showing dedication and ability to rise to challenges as needed, and reliably performing in demanding circumstances. I have been told by my manager that I am one of the few individuals who can be dropped into any problem and make an impact, and my work in this review period provides evidence to back that assertion, and why I am making a case for promotion to Staff Engineer.",,,Jason Ziglar,jziglar@argo.ai,Jason Ziglar,jziglar@argo.ai,Software,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Jason has had a ton of accomplishments since he started here.  I have been lucky enough to work with over half of the time (for this review cycle), and have been fortunate enough to sit beside him.  

On the localization team he was instrumental in making design decisions like the design of the local map interface which allowed the system to transition from a large aprior map to a tiled map to cached maps pretty seamlessly without affecting the rest of the localization code.  He also got the localization stack turning over on the car which was a big undertaking.  Another big accomplishment is that he solidified the non deterministic lidar stack quickly and was able to get it to a point where it lasted through the Q4 push.  Without his membership on the team i doubt if the localization team would have been successful.  

Jason also acquired the position of c++ reader, a position that he does extremely well.  He is always someone you could count on to read your code and give and honest accurate review.  The review comments are always able to be backed up with supporting information if requested.  

The mentoring from Jason through this review period has been helpful in my growth as an engineer.   The discussions about design trade offs and code design decisions have helped me to better solidify the trade offs and when to make certain decisions.  His wealth of expertise in both software design and robotics makes him a great resource for almost any question.  This mentorship attitude carries on beyond just me, because Jason is willing to answer peoples questions on slack and rarely in my experience turns down code reviews.  I have also seen him work with others like Nick to help them grow.

Jason's work ethic is impressive and is inspiring even if it is hard/impossible to live up to...  When hours are demanded he shows up and gets the job done.  No only are long hours worked but they are productive hours.  (One wonders if he is actually a robot as he never stops being effective. ) Code red was a perfect instance of this.  He worked multiple weekends to help the software team dig itself out of the rut that it was in.  He is also around to help out in off hours all the time.  Multiple times i had him bless PR's for me off hours and he is always checking the queue.

Jason works well with others on his team.  He provides clear and accurate feedback and opinions. He also is willing to hear the other side of the argument.  This listening to your argument even when he is pretty sure is right is rare from someone with his skills and experience.   One of ARGOs core values is being humble.  Jason exemplifies this.

",,,Ben Xinjilefu,xxx@argo.ai,Jason Ziglar,jziglar@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Jason and I first worked together during code red as part of the team diagnosing latency spikes on vehicle.  Prior to this, our interactions were brief and mostly consisted of one-off questions (e.g., about changes to the queue).  However, since code red, our paths have crossed more often and I have really enjoyed working with Jason.  He is a tremendously hard worker, has great experiences that others can learn from, and is a great person to brainstorm with.

**Development of the new lidar pipeline**

Working on the new lidar pipeline was the first major project that I worked with Jason on.   There was a great deal of emphasis on building this pipeline correctly, because it had already been re-written twice.  The goals were to fix some of the instabilities in past implementations and produce consistent results for our current architecture while allowing for expansion to accommodate future demands.  Jason did a great job balancing these goals during development of this new pipeline.  For example, this pipeline was designed as 3 self-contained components.  If the computational demand of this pipeline increased in the future, we saw the potential for each component to operate independently on its own thread.  When implementing this pipeline, Jason paid very close attention to making sure the design allowed for this expansion.  However, in knowing that the current demands would not require threading, his implementation choices were practical.  The final result is one that is open to expansion, but was done efficiently and has proven to be consistent and solid. 

**Working in a team**

Putting technical details aside, Jason is a great person to have on your team.  He has a lot of experiences and knowledge that he can share while brainstorming possible solutions.  During reviews, he gives quality and constructive feedback.  He is not shy about vocalizing his opinion, but does so in a professional and productive manner.  Similarly, he is receptive to feedback on his own work.  It can be easy to take suggestions personally, but these discussions with Jason are professional and objective.

**Other responsibilities**

In addition to the technical work Jason does, he takes on a lot of other responsibilities.

Worked with Jason on the lidar pipeline rewrite. He completely owned the new driver and did a great job, analyzing and identifying problems with the previous driver. He then designed a very straight forward efficient system that gave us all of the missing functionality we needed. Also, his analysis of the impact on network traffic was excellent.

Jason has taken on a lot of scope since he was hired. He keeps getting thrown at new problems and those problems are always the biggest fires burning in the organization. First that was localization when there was no team, then it was the lidar pipeline, then it was the build system. Those fires always go out after he's done working on the projects.

* Improving communication in large scale changes. In developing the new LiDAR pipeline design, design documents were made publicly available and feedback invited, but some subtleties in how timestamps in LiDAR messages were used weren't caught in these communications.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"In my first 6 months at Argo, I've gained a tremendous amount of experience. My work has spanned the following areas.

* Visualization
   - Designed the code architecture for the TrajectoryGeneratorDebug Plugin and Widget, based on a visual design specification, and implemented it. This Plugin/Widget serves as an important debugging tool for our team. In particular, it allows us to visualize trajectories and waypoints (tabular and graphical form) and constraints (tabular only) for a particular trajectory. This tool has proved to be very important for both online and offline debugging.
   - Identified and specified potential architectural and tooling improvements for the Visualization team which if implemented, would significantly improve code reuse, and significantly reduce implementation and maintenance efforts.

* Trajectory Generator
   - During Code Red, implemented a mechanism for improving fault tolerance of the Trajectory Generator, which has since been used on our other tasks. This allowed us to wrap many methods in a try/catch while also performing logging and setting diagnostics. Learning and ramping up on diagnostics quickly proved to be essential to the success of this task.
  - Also during Code Red, implemented message timeout checking.
  - Implemented a first-pass contingency-contingency stop trajectory and learned a great deal about critical component development in the process. Worked closely with Senior Engineers in both MP and MC, and escalated decision making when needed. 

* Behaviors
   - Helped refactor the CombinedIntersection behavior by cleaning up and streamlining some of the code.
   - Modified End of Path behavior for supporting lane changes near intersections

* Field Testing
   - Performed extensive on-board vehicle field testing both with the team and on my own at New Stanton for 2 weeks during a major refactor of our core data structure. This was in preparation for a high profile demo.

* Teamwork
   - All of these areas required a large amount of coordination and communication with members of our team, and more recently, members of other teams.
   - Field testing required close coordination and communication with Ops, Staff and Senior Engineers and subsystem experts on our team. I worked closely with most of our team members to make sure I had workable test plan, and at times, asked subsystem experts and ranking experts to join a complex test to make nothing was missed. I also quickly and clearly communicated test results, and even diagnosed a few, so that issues could be resolved iterated upon quickly.
   - I have also taken time to work with new members of the team on areas that I understand, to help them get up to speed as quickly as possible. I believe that effective training and on-boarding is essential to team success.

 * Code Quality
   - As a Software Engineer by training, I've championed initiatives that improve code quality, and in code reviews, focused on areas of readability, testability, extensibility, efficiency, and maintainability. ",,,Jay Sidhu,jsidhu@argo.ai,Jay Sidhu,jsidhu@argo.ai,Software,

He has taken ownership of the TrajectoryGeneratorPlugin and Widget. This is a critical visualization tool used for troubleshooting simulations and logs. The plugin has served us well and he is now redesigning it to be even better.

Jay worked especially hard during code red, getting our code into compliance with best error handling practices. He also worked very hard in preparation for the 3/29 demo. He stayed late several nights testing at New Stanton.

Jay’s PRs are consistently high quality. They typically require few changes. I worked with Jay on landing the CombinedIntersection behavior. I started this refactor before code red, but Jay ultimately got it tested and landed. 

Jay has a positive attitude. He is friendly and respectful in all team interactions.",,,Neal Seegmiller,nseegmiller@argo.ai,Jay Sidhu,jsidhu@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Jay has ramped up very well on the MP stack and Argo codebase. Not having a robotics background hasn't stopped him from being able to contribute to the codebase and in many senses his past experience has allowed him to contribute different points of views and approaches. For example, he approaches problems from a fault tolerance perspective, which helped with the rework during code red.

Jay took on the daunting task of writing the TrajectoryGeneratorDebug plugin and widget. This tool has served to be very useful in understanding our system. It is useful in field testing to be able to see what that MP stack is choosing and has saved countless hours trying to debug logs - it shows multiple streams of relevant information at the same time whereas before this existed we would have to resim and use print statements.

Jay helped considerably with code red and made the TrajectoryGenerator much more robust than it was previously.  The code that he wrote set up the foundation to many utilities and practices for error checking throughout the TrajectoryGenerator code flow as well as other tasks.  

Jay also had a large hand in the conversion of the TrajectoryGenerator from the MotionPlan to the CorridorMap object.  He took on the task of converting several behaviors and many utilities and unit tests, not only converting those objects but also switching from std::optional to Maybe in the code he was touching. Through his efforts he was able to uncover several bugs that he was able to fix.

Jay works well with others, working to understand how other parts of the codebase works.",,,Ramadev Hukkeri,rhukkeri@argo.ai,Jay Sidhu,jsidhu@argo.ai,Software,

Accomplishments: As mentioned in his self-review. He is proudest of his PRs 431, 2378, 4203, and his current vis PR chain; I support this view, and also point out his introduction of diagnostics and work with error codes as exemplars of his work.

Some of my assessments are impressions, not necessarily objective facts, and I've indicated as such with an (Imp)

What are areas where this person has grown and made improvements?
----

[1] Picked up Argo coding conventions and C++ in general fairly quickly, as evinced by the fact that he leaves:

*  detailed reviews he leaves on my PRs. Representative PR #4979.Some of his  concerns there needed a response directly rather than a code change; noenetheless they were valid.

* Raises questions, e.g. on diagnostics duration and the unsuitability of using ErrorCode as outparams in Slack threads.


[2]  (Imp) hard working and dedicated - given the long hours put in during the Code Red and 29 March demos. While ""long hours"" itself is not in general an indicator of any one's work output,they are a given in these exceptional circumstances; it's almost impossible to succeed without them.

[3] Active learner of C++. Comment left here about the boost adapter pattern on PR 4825 about the boost adapter pattern. KEEP THIS UP! Most of our team is content to confine itself to Argo standards. This comment was a welcome exception. 


Think about not only results, but also about how this person collaborates and works with others.
-------

In  general, coordinating with him has worked out well for me, given the fact that we sit in different offices in different time zones. I would rely on him more than anyone else at PIT in high-pressure bug-fix situations.

* During code red, jsidhu and I fixed unit test errors late into the night. Working with him made it easier for me to diagnose the root cause of issues, given that I was otherwise exhausted.

* Prior to the 29/03 Demo, he had issues rebasing my branch into his (MP-1561) just prior to testing on AV. The rebase failed to have some commits;  

* (Imp) We once had a nice discussion about about the need for bootstrapping the localization process in the AV. Keep up the learning about robotics and motion planning! ",,,Ganesh Peruvemba Kumar,gkumar@argo.ai,Jay Sidhu,jsidhu@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Jay is a valuable member of the motion planning team whose software contributions are on par with Software Engineer II members of our team. He demonstrates a good knowledge of modern C++ through his own software and through code reviews. His background as a software engineer makes him an asset to the team.

Jay put in a lot of long hours and hard work during the run-up to the March 29 demo. He was our main support person at New Stanton, where he worked to test lane changing and provide test data to the rest of the team.

Jay is able to work independently on tasks with limited supervision, including tasks with critical implications for the system, such as the contingency stop functionality he recently added. For that feature, he coordinated with motion control and test ops to land the necessary changes with no major regressions. Jay responded quickly to fix the one small bug introduced by the changes.

Jay has become our go-to person for the parts of the visualization code he originally wrote, but he is a valuable contributor throughout the codebase.

In my opinion, Jay should be promoted to Software Engineer II.",,,Ed Venator,evenator@argo.ai,Jay Sidhu,jsidhu@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"In the past six months, Jay has worked on quite a few different tasks and projects. These include:
* TrajectoryGeneratorPlugin/Widget - This, in particular, has been very helpful. This is the visualization tool I use for almost all of my debugging these days. Jay designed and implemented this from scratch. The plugin is generally easy to use and he has been willing to make changes based on feedback.
* Jay did a lot of the on-vehicle testing in the run up to the demo to make sure we could get lane change working. He quickly learned how to run development test and was able to provide me tips and tricks when I went out testing (e.g. best practices for bootstrapping and scp-ing logs off of the car)
* Implemented a contingency-stopping trajectory that is used when TrajectoryGenerator fails to find a good solution. 
* Jay improved error checking in TrajectoryGenerator during code red. He added try-catch blocks around the important functions and also implemented diagnostics in our tasks.

Jay sets aside time for code reviews. His reviews often point out places where we could improve our c++ style or formatting. They show that he has a good understanding of the c++ language and general software engineering practices. He has steadily improved in this regard, slowly becoming more assertive in his reviews. Jay is great to work with and eager to help out throughout the system.
",,,Chris Cunningham,ccunningham@argo.ai,Jay Sidhu,jsidhu@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Jay sometimes chooses somewhat awkward design patterns. For example, the try/catch wrapper he implemented during code red, though effective at quarantining exceptions, was somewhat opaque and made the code harder to read.

Although Jay's background is in non-robotics software engineering, he has a good understanding of what our software does and how it works. I would value more contributions from him in our design discussions.

Jay needs to speed louder in meetings :P",,,Ed Venator,evenator@argo.ai,Jay Sidhu,jsidhu@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"* Communication
  - I'm consistently improving in my ability to communicate with members of my team and to raise concerns as quickly as practical, but I'd like to keep improving in this area.
  - Being able to connect early and raise concerns or questions quickly will help me accomplish my tasks faster and develop stronger working relationships with my team members - I have more to do here.
  - One example where communicating earlier would have helped is in developing code for the contingency-contingency stop trajectory. Engaging senior engineers earlier would have led to an earlier understanding of the problem and it's constraints, and allowed me to develop a solution faster and more accurately. 

* Breaking up large tasks into more manageable parts
 - Some tasks I have taken on have ended up being very large
 - I have learned to break these into smaller tickets to make deliverables more consistent, however I have room to improve
 - Breaking down very large tasks will help me better understand them and deliver on a more consistent basis, instead of in less frequent and large chunks, and will help significantly for estimating remaining work.
  - Two examples of tasks that took much longer than expected and where breaking them up would have helped (at least for work estimation) are the Trajectory Generator Debug Plugin and Widget, and refactoring Combined Intersection behavior by removing a large state data structure.

 * Robotics oriented tasks
   - I provide lots of review feedback on and am highly productive with tasks that are more generally software design oriented.
  - Although I'm becoming more familiar with Robotics and Motion Planning specific problems, I'd like to get a much better understanding of them so I can contribute more in these areas. I will dedicate spare cycles and off work hours to familiarizing myself more with these concepts.",,,Jay Sidhu,jsidhu@argo.ai,Jay Sidhu,jsidhu@argo.ai,Software,

This is a worthwhile endeavor, but Jay already has sufficient knowledge and experience on the software engineering side to make big contributions. We need software improvements just as much as we need algorithmic improvements. 

My recommendations to Jay are, familiarize yourself with the existing codebase as much as possible, and look for ways to make our codebase simpler, cleaner, more maintainable, robust and efficient. Participate in design efforts by speaking up more in meetings, and reviewing design docs. Seek out opportunities to lead design efforts yourself, in an area you are comfortable with.

* (Imp) Feel he could be more open and pointed in Sprint meetings. Often he is quiet and speaks softly; I fear his (valuable) opinions could get lost among those of our less quieter team members.  he should speak up if he feels the need

* 

Projects where he could have done better

* (Imp) I feel that he (as the rest of the Pittsburgh team) could get more effective at streamlining field testing. I make this point purely for his benefit, for I'm well aware of the long hours and weekends put in by the team for field tests. It's possibly the most physically exhausting part of our work.

* His first project on TG Debug visualization took about 3 weeks; I had the impression that he was struggling through the project. I'm quite sure part of this was his learning curve, with possibly an underestimate of the task contributing to it. As he himself mentions in his self-review, I hope he takes the time to either breakdown tasks appropriately, or seek help as needed. 

* The try catch set diagnostic (PR 1721) which he introduced was a great innovation in its time (code-red period) but failed to be maintainable. This is the sort of complexity he (and the rest of us) should strive to avoid.

* (Imp) During code red, I ran into the ODR violation indicated here: https://github.com/argoai/av/pull/2053/files#r165415623
It was a hard fix to diagnose, esp. under the time pressure. I wish this had been thought out and implemented better (between him and @evenator).  I do understand that that's an ambitious goal.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"While Jay is good at reviewing code for formatting and style, he could still improve in reviewing code to make sure it logically does what it is intended to do.  Jay is naturally a soft-spoken person. He could work on trying to speak more loudly in meetings so that people both in the room and remotely can more easily hear him.

Jay could also still improve in estimating how long projects are going to take. For example, when working on CombinedIntersection and the TrajectoryGenerator plugin, his estimates for when he was going to be done were significantly lower than what it actually took. While time estimates are never perfect, perhaps some more time planning up front would improve accuracy.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Since joining Argo in Oct, I have built a financial framework for budget development, spend management, and executive reporting from scratch. Additionally, I developed headcount reporting to drive visibility and alignment on expectations between hiring managers, executive team, and recruiters. Finally, I developed people policies such as principles for raises / bonuses from performance reviews and the professional development stipend criteria. 
 
1)  Result: Built a process to develop Argo's 1st ever Annual Budget, allowing management, with the Board of Directors, to align on financial expectations to manage to in 2018.
     Situation: Within a month of joining Argo, Argo needs first ever Annual Budget for Board Approval entering into 2018. However, team leads did not have any insight into what their spend profile was historically to be able to project what they would need going forward.
     Action: Sorted through 2017 actuals (not previously reported or analyzed) to understand spending trends and drivers during Argo’s 1st year of operations. After understanding the data, I organized it and provided it to all spend leads across Argo (10+ departments) for insight into their data to aid in developing spending asks for 2018  with clear explanations and justifications for growth drivers. Additionally, I developed budget models for all other company expenses, most significantly Compensation and T&E, not managed by 1 lead in particular.

2)  Result: Established monthly financial trajectory review process and reporting (customized by department for example HW reported at Vendor & PO level vs Facilities reported by Location) which 
    a) Provides granular visibility to budget managers into their actuals so forecasts for future periods may be grounded in real data (for example, IT SW licenses steady monthly cost during the period of the license)
     b) Allows budget managers data required to manage to their budget and make spending trade-offs as needed to remain within the approved spend for the year (for example, Hardware team reducing spend on some components to offset overspend in AVS)
     c) Provides executive management with monthly insight into the state of the business. Flagging early and often risks to overspending budget and deep diving into areas of interest such as hiring ramp during the period and hardware spend by component. This drove management deep dives into hiring plans to ensure alignment and clear direction, reducing pressure to budget. 
*Through this process, during Q1, Argo's monthly actuals were within 10% of forecast with no significant surprises.
    Situation: No prior process for budget managers to have visibility on a monthly basis into their significant spend drivers.
    Action: Built files for each budget lead with varying views / levels of granularity. Hold monthly meetings with each budget owner, after having updated actuals from the prior month, to discuss updates to forecasts and pressure to budget. This information is then summarized and rolled up to executive level reporting so management has a good pulse on the financial state of the company and risks to overspending budget that are being tracked for discussion.

3)  Result: Constructed headcount reporting (go/headcount) and worked through hiring plan reviews with exec team and leads. The hiring plan reviews clarified and focused hiring plans which resulted in target reduction with financial impact of ~$5M to 2018. This reporting is used to drive alignment on hiring priorities and target availability between hiring managers, team leads, and recruiting. Finally, this reporting enables & flags the review of backfills from attrition to assess if the role should be backfilled as it was or rescoped to better address current priorities.
    Situation: Many hiring managers did not know how many headcount target they were allocated for the year nor did they have an org plan, but requested the recruiting team to hire quickly for vague roles. This led to confusion on priorities, pressure to budget, and the need to reorg teams.
    Action: Collaborating with PeopleOps and Recruiting, I utilized HR owned data (ADP / ANS) to create active tracking current butts in seats compared to the # of target approved by the exec team for 2018 growth. I then added a “control check” to map the open roles managed by the recruiting team to the # of target available to be hired by each sub-team (go/headcount) to ensure alignment between the roles being sourced to the # of target available to be hired. 

4)  Result: Established forecast vs actual control checks to ensure material accuracy of monthly expenses booked by the accounting team prior to reporting to Ford. For example, some of the errors that have been found to date include duplicative rent expense in January, missing LinkedIn expense in March, and items capitalized as computer software instead of computer hardware.
   Situation: No check of monthly actuals for accuracy / completeness of expenses booked, driving risk of misstatement to Ford / auditors. 
   Action:Developed detailed monthly actuals vs forecast analysis, which is reviewed with budget owners monthly, and investigate significant variances with the accounting team in order to identify errors to be corrected before books are closed

5)  Result: Deal review pipeline tracker (go/dealreviewtracker) instituted, improving deal review slide creation and discussions. Utilizing the tracker, on a weekly basis I check-in with deal leads on status of significant upcoming spend negotiations to ensure deals are reviewed and approved timely. Additionally, I pre-review and prep all leads going to deal review, assisting in financial slide development, to enable effective executive level conversations for approval.
    Situation: Deal reviews were performed ad hoc, often via email, with limited discussions prior to approval and no review by cross-functional support teams of the terms / slides in advance
    Action: Created a tracker, manage the agenda and notes for each meeting, partner with the deal leads to review the terms prior to finalization of negotiation and prepare the financial slides for the deck / meeting.

6)  Result: Drafted a salary / bonus adjustment policy based upon performance reviews, which was accepted by executive team and rolled out immediately for 2017 perf cycle. 
    Situation: Argo was going through it’s 1st annual performance reviews to result in salary & bonus adjustments but did not have a policy for what the compensation impact would be for each rating result.   
    Action: During my 1st 3 days at Argo, I analyzed our target salary bands and current compensation levels (identifying some mismatched levels to bands in the process) and developed a set of principles, modeling the financial impact of different curve scenarios.",,,Jen DeBrincat,jdebrincat@argo.ai,Jen DeBrincat,jdebrincat@argo.ai,General & Administrative,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"I've mostly worked with Jen D on budget reviews and headcount planning.  
Budget - with limited information on budgets/spending, I imagine it was difficult to create the forecast for teams.  I worked with Jen to anticipate Recruiting's costs and she has been helpful in keeping us on track per quarter.  Jen's ability to pinpoint discrepancies is awesome - we were able to identify an issue with candidate vs employee travel costs and sorted it out to the accurate reporting path.
Headcount - Jen had a challenging task to gather headcount requirements at a fast paced/high volume hiring startup that didn't have enough consistent quarters to project a hiring target.  In reviewing 2018 budgets, Jen was able distill hiring down to a specific number and then worked with HMs to get additional details such as quarter to hire, assigned level ranges, etc.  We've been working through some changes to the original plan, but the setup of this process from Jen was excellent.  She's quick to pivot on suggested changes, making her easy to work with. ",,,Jenn Gustin,jenn@argo.ai,Jen DeBrincat,jdebrincat@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"In my opinion, Jen has made one of the biggest impacts as a new employee that I have witnessed at Argo.  I have seen most folks come into this organization and have had the opportunity to work with many of them as well, and I don't think that I have experienced the level of impact that Jen has made with any other employee! 

From day 1 Jen had impact on the organization.  She started out with implementing process around the performance review salary/bonus structure for Argo.  She analyzed the data around salaries and bonuses and provided a banding that worked with the ratings for overall performance by individuals.  Jen is a very analytical thinker and approaches problems with a quantitative approach, so this fit right into her wheelhouse!

I was asked to sit on the interview panel for the Finance Manager position.  When I interviewed Jen I was super excited about the possibility of her joining the team.  She and I had a great conversation and so much of her experience fit the needs of the organization and filled the gaps that we had been experiencing.  My biggest problem from a financial perspective, as a budget owner, was that I did not know what my budget was and I did not have insight into the spend that was happening within my own team.  Jen came in, assessed the situation and made huge improvements almost immediately.  Initially, she was able to run reports and provide insight when requested, but as she got her feet under her, she created monthly reports that are reviewed by both the budget owner and her monthly.  This has been a huge help to me for multiple reasons:

1.  It allows me to see the entire spend of my team.  With having a team that spans multiple locations, this is a huge help to make sure that folks are staying within the budgets set for projects and that the team as a whole is spending within the limits.

2.  This report has provided a holistic approach to the IT budgeting.  It allows the team to make choices and to set priorities with the budget in mind!

3.  And with the start up of so many new sites, it provides a window into the budgeted, actuals and projected states of the larger capital projects that IT has been involved in this year.

Jen also worked to put together the 2018 budget for the company.  This was a huge task as many had little to no insight into their spend or the trends.  Jen came in, ran the analysis, and helped make sense of the spend for each budget owner.  She knew what questions to ask to get through separating the spend into categories, she knew what others were including in their budgets so to avoid double budgeting for the same items (example the hardware teams software licensing needs were included in the IT budget instead of the hardware budget), and she was able to help you to think about your spend from a holistic standpoint.  She did a great job and this really highlighted her talents and strengths!  Jen is able to pull data from folks in a way that is not intimidating or demeaning.  She helps you to think about all aspects of the particular business unit that you are responsible for to ensure a comprehensive budget is submitted.  

Jen has also participated in several projects that I have been involved with that are not necessarily budget related but more process related.  One example of this was the work that she did on the Software Licensing policy.  This project spanned multiple groups, IT, Finance, Legal, and Procurement!  Jen took the lead on this and has been driving the process.  She has also partnered with IT to use a tool that they are working to put in place, Salt,  to be able to do software licensing inventories on each end point so that an audit can be done to compare the number of licenses verse the number of end points using the product.  She has been great to work with and is great at following up for check ins to assess progress.

I have also worked with Jen on 2 deal reviews.  She has put together a template to use for these meetings making sure that the leadership team receives all of the necessary information needed to make a decision.  She is very conscientious of their time and works hard to keep these meetings on track and productive for all parties involved.  However, even though she has a template, she is very aware that the template does not fit all scenarios.  She and I are actually going to be working on a template for deal reviews for capital building reviews.  This will help to focus the information relevant to this type of deal which differs greatly from say a components deal for the hardware team. 

I also interact with Jen within procurement.  She is responsible for the approval of all purchases over $5K.  She knows what is budgeted and what is not and she asks the right questions.  Sometimes you wish that she didn't, LOL, but she will push back on what she does not think has been budgeted for and she will help to resolve issues, if there is a need but no budget!  She really does try to balance the purchases with the budget and the need!  But Jen is not afraid to ask questions!

Overall, Jen has made a tremendous impact on the organization since joining the team!  She has proven her ability to contribute as an individual, she has proven her ability to work as a part of a team and she has proven her ability to think outside of the box!  She is a great addition and I am so happy to have had the opportunity to work with her!",,,Kelly Mullins,kmullins@argo.ai,Jen DeBrincat,jdebrincat@argo.ai,General & Administrative,

There was a time in the early days where headcount planning got kind of confusing. The finance team and the recruiting team briefly had separate documents to track headcount plans, and both documents were a little bit unwieldy to use. I *think* we have converged the documents recently, but I haven’t been involved in headcount planning discussions recently. Perhaps I would encourage Jen to make sure she aligns Finance Team planning documents with the requirements of other teams before kicking off new planning tools to avoid situations where we end up with redundant tracking tools.",,,Wes Ford,wford@argo.ai,Jen DeBrincat,jdebrincat@argo.ai,General & Administrative,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Since hire in late December 2017, I’ve had the opportunity to tackle a number of critical projects and initiatives for Argo. 

Team Build & Management: 
Foremost, I have put a focus on expanding the People Operations team to more effectively and efficiently service the org. With the hires of Maria, Julie, and Ali, we’ve been able to specialize the team into fundamental focus areas that best support the needs of the teams. POps has split into the following focus areas: Benefits & Compensation (Equity), Onboarding, Experience & Engagement, Learning & Development, Data & Compliance, Business Partnerships (specialized by departments based on highest needs). These specializations coincide not only with expertise on the team, but with career objectives for each. We have also absorbed headcount from Recruiting to expand and improve the Contractor Program with Jenn Sweet’s shift to POps. We’ll continue to round out the team by adding additional headcount in Mountain View for Business Partnership with Hardware, Lidar, Supply Chain teams. The POps team was understaffed, and thus, purely reactive to the needs of employees and leadership. At this time, we have turned the corner, and are able to begin taking on more proactive and strategic initiatives. In Q1, I set OKRs for our team with un-edited approval, and drove the team and myself to achieve 80%. Each POps team member had contributory responsibility for OKRs, and I focused on executing against high-level initiatives, as well as individual growth goals in our weekly 1:1 meetings. I provided strategic guidance on achieving OKRs, as well as independently executed against them personally.  

I have proven to operate at an L7 and L8 in this way, as I have built and managed the ICs of the People Ops team, responsible for the strategic growth of the individuals as well as the overall function. I have executed against this successfully in a short time. We have been able to drive initiatives in each of these focus areas that push Argo forward and provide substantial impact to overall benefits, experience and satisfaction of the team. These initiatives are not only People Ops specific, but guide and provide strategic vision in People Ops focus areas across the org. For example, developing broad Experience and Diversity programs that will impact the greater team and ultimately recruiting and retainment.  I strategically led the team through our Q1 OKRs to achieve an above average / anticipated score. The team and partners in the organization have required guidance as we began to build the People Ops machine, and I have been able to respond thoroughly and with precise expertise against all needs and inquiries. I have received positive feedback from team and leadership, with things such as “Great work - very well done OKRs.”, “You killed it!”, “I am so glad that you are here - everything is different now and it has been awesome.” 

Performance Improvement & Strategic Guidance to Leaders: 
Unaddressed, or partially addressed performance issues were one of my first observations at hire. Since January, I have been able to successfully partner with managers and leadership across the org to do a full performance assessment by functional team and initiate remediation where needed. In all cases, individuals were given adequate time and feedback (most on Performance Improvement Plans) to have an achievable opportunity at improvement. In some cases, these individuals were off-boarded, all of which were handled with poise and kindness, providing as positive an experience possible for the affected individual, while ultimately supporting and protecting Argo. A large part of these performance conversations were also learning opportunities for managers, wherein some were inexperienced with providing feedback, lacked understanding of how to tie performance to job ladders, and ultimately, how to plan their orgs successfully. I was able to leverage these situations to provide 1:1 coaching with managers in the org who were most in need of guidance. I believe all of these managers have a better understanding and more firm foundation today in how to provide feedback regularly, how to manage underperformers, how to manage high performers and those under strain on a team with an underperformer, and how to recognize when attrition can/should be healthy for the team and the organization (and most often, also that individual).  

At an L7 level, I have proved to exercise precise judgement against HR fundamentals, as well as manage and influence others on the seriousness of processes and methodologies. It was clear to me that many managers needed guidance both through determination stage, and practical delivery of off-boarding. My expertise and domain experience in this area allowed for me to plan strategically in these sensitive situations and guide in senior leadership roles on high risk scenarios and mitigation. Ultimately, difficult decisions were made, but all executed effectively and without drama or disruption. 

The Spring Performance Cycle was fully planned and kick-started with training materials rolling out to the org at the end of Q1. Ahead of the cycle, we went through a number of options to vet Lattice as the performance system. While the goal was to consolidate systems where possible and improve the backend administrative components, we ultimately settled to stay within Lattice as it, at this time, best services the needs of the org and allows transparent and comprehensive reviews. The exercise was important to fully vet the benefits and capabilities of the system to ensure we’re providing a comprehensive solution to the org. 

At an L7 and L8 level, evaluating the most effective performance tools was necessary to ensure that the team continued to work efficiently, and that the tools presented to the organization were effective, provided ease of use, and ultimately achieved our goals. Analyzing the options was essential to ensuring we were best serving the organization, even when under extreme time pressure to make a decision. During this process, there were varying and differing opinions among senior leadership. I was able to manage these conversations and provide a finalized, compromised and collected solution to satisfy all parties and ultimately, best serve Argo. 

Partnership:
I have had the opportunity to work closely with cross-functional partners, and provide solutions for a variety of needs. Once example was a last minute ask to provide a written summary of our employee development and training opportunities, as well as our diversity program, to complete Argo's application for a $3M CA Tax Credit. Being in the early throws of this at Argo, and despite an OOO conflict, I wordsmithed an accurate depiction of Argo's platforms today, and where we hope to be soon and got it to my internal stakeholder ahead of deadline. Feedback was very encouraging, ""This is perfect, thanks!"" and ""this is excellent, Jen!  Bravo!"". 

Audit: 
We completed a full inversion analysis and audit across the organization to be able to identify areas of misalignment in terms of leveling or compensation, as well as a remediation plan to rectify issues if/where identified. Additionally, all employee files have been updated and permissions appropriately assigned. I have documented and trained the team on data sharing, audit and compliance best practices, and have worked with the team to establish a regular audit cadence and responsibility matrix across all systems and output within the team. 

The audit process and resolutions have proven my ability to lead the team through an audit process that resolves wholly and effectively, as well as personally audit and deliver accurate and thorough data. This directly correlates with responsibilities at an L7 level, as well as expertise and responsibility at L8. We have instituted a number of new audit practices and overall, have drastically improved the audit and compliance function of People Ops. Not only does this support the goals of our own team, but ultimately protects Argo, Argo data, and services the organization overall. 

HR Fundamentals: 
The core HR function at Argo was missing certain components that I was able to successfully execute in Q1 of this year. There was a heavily-lawyered version of an Employee Handbook in loose circulation with no one truly guiding the process to completion. I took initiative on this and spend a good bit of time editing the starting doc and enhancing in a way that not only met Argo’s needs, but provided additional policies relevant to our operation, as well as tempered the language in the Handbook to carry the Argo voice. At the beginning of Q2, we have successfully completed 100% of Handbook Acknowledgements across the org. The Argo Employee Handbook satisfied a number of the requirements on the Policy & Procedure Matrix, and POps was additionally able to ensure that we were up to date and fully executed against the P&P. I worked with Kate (GC) to provide a comprehensive Handbook that solved business needs, but was also mindful of what we want Argo to be and stand for. This balance was achieved and well-received across senior leadership. Feedback from senior leadership on the handbook was positive, to include, ""Jen, I reviewed the employee handbook, great work.  Left a few comments throughout but nothing major.""

With respect to Policy & Procedure Matrix, not only have I have developed processes where they were non-existent or proved to have significant gaps, I have been able to do so in a short time frame with accuracy and have evangelized within the team quickly. Our self-audits and process reviews have been without major flaws and we continue to see fruitful results from documenting processes and following procedural guidelines. 
These projects, namely the Handbook (as well as Ladders and Anti-Harassment training), have had significant visibility within the organization and have been successful implementations of HR Fundamental needs at Argo.

The team needed significant guidance on best practices, day to day feedback on responding to complex employee concerns, and guidance on executing against organization initiatives. Not only have I been able to resolve these needs, answer outstanding questions and provide guidance on previously ignored or unresolved content for the People Operations team, I have also been able to provide guidance and wisdom to leadership at Argo where there was previously a heavy gap. 

Ladders: 
Argo ladders were in need of a number of additions. I worked directly with managers and functional leads to build ladders for the organization. At Spring Perf, the majority of ladders for the org are live, with two remaining in close-to-completion draft. These ladders not only allow better benchmarking for performance across the org, but they are also a great tool for individuals at Argo to understand our commitment to their career growth. This, along with the Handbook, was a highly visible individual project that I took on within my first quarter at Argo, to ensure that we had successful measurement standards and could provide exceptional detail to staff on their career growth. 

Training: 
Anti-Harassment Training was a priority for me at hire, as we’d fallen into non-compliance with the State of California. After a few iterations and reviews of external resources, I settled on Traliant’s Anti-Harassment module. If time had been on our side, it would have been ideal to have an in-person training to alleviate the mundane necessity of this training. I picked the best of the worst, and we were able to execute across the organization. In Q1, we were able to achieve 100% completion of the course across the org, and have pulled this into the New Hire Onboarding process to maintain compliance moving forward. Forward looking, we will continue to vet in-person training options for future facilitation. While time was against us on this training, I was able to effectively execute a compromised solution that worked to meet the organization’s need, with a plan for strategic improvement moving forward. As a peer stated, “I really enjoyed the training. There was a lot covered that I didn’t expect, but think it was great.” 

In January, a last minute request was made to present a manager overview training to the Software org during their offsite. I was dedicated to building a relevant, critical information deck that was directly tied to their needs and growth opportunities as a group. The training was successful, and I received a number of follow up questions and 1:1 meetings to work through topics within the training. The managers in the org were receptive and appreciative of the information and the deck I built has been a landing spot for managers. We will continue to enhance this deck and expand to meet the needs of all teams and management levels across the organization. I received direct feedback from these slides from executive leadership, wherein they stated “Really excellent management training slides”. From participants in the session, I received a number of positive verbal and email responses, most notably, “Your presentation was awesome and helped us align. I suspect they’ve needed this for some time. Thanks for pulling it together!” 

Benefits Enhancements: 
Voluntary Life and LTD were benefit changes that we rolled out to the organization ahead of the traditional open enrollment schedule. The POps team received a good bit of feedback from the org requesting this change, as well as from the Leadership level. We were able to successfully negotiate re-pricing with Unum to reduce our current costs for Basic Life and STD, as well as make changes to those offerings for zero financial impact to the org, with additional benefit (longer lookback periods, increase guarantee issue to $500k). This was a direct ask of the CEO, and I was confident in accomplishing the goals with Unum, as well as satisfying the needs of executive leadership internally. I was able to provide timely updates along the way, and overall, achieved successful changes that benefit the organization financially, and provided significant impact to our benefit offering to employees at all levels. Feedback was very positive, to include, ""This is better!  I'm good with your recommendations."" 

In addition to traditional benefit offerings, we have added a number of enhanced benefits across Argo that the POps team has driven to completion, to include: Parental Leave, with increased benefits for maternity and paternity, Spot and Peer Bonus programs, Professional Development Stipend. 
Onboarding: The team has made a number of improvements to the Onboarding program, with several others in development. The Welcome Buddy program was enhanced with a New Hire Roadmap that I created to better assimilate a new hire to their team and active projects, as well as provide an avenue for them to understand the history of the work and past challenges. Emphasis has been added to the Welcome Buddy Program to include reportable surveys from the WB a month post-hire to ensure program success and continued growth. We’ve revamped the schedules and will be implementing team-specific trainings (beginning with splitting into Tech and Non-Tech with initial focus on Software), as well as creating a Ride-Along program for new hires. At the L7 level, I have successfully been able to impact the actions and priorities of my team to be directed to executing against programs and methodologies with high visibility and impact to Argo. I have been a focused guide to my ICs on best practices, foundational knowledge, and past experience to build out programs that push Argo forward in this area. 

Diversity: 
I partnered with Jenn Gustin to jumpstart our Diversity & Inclusion program at Argo. We presented our plan and to-date achievements in Diversity, and encouraged the organization to participate in Employee Resource Groups. POps created and facilitated the sign-up process, allowing the org to self-identify areas of interest and kick-start the ERGs. Women at Argo has had tremendous impact already, led by POps, with community involvement and sponsored female speakers. We continue to enhance the program, and I have personally invested a great deal of time to retaining a top performing female engineer to help grow this effort. Along with diversity, comes a number of complex inquiries from staff and managers. I have not only trained my team on best practices in this area, but have worked closely with managers in 1:1 scenarios where they have raised questions or concerns on their own teams. For my team, we have been able to develop a high level strategy for how we go about achieving a successful diversity program at Argo, and have begun to push these concepts across the organization. The leadership team has been incredibly supportive of the effort. 

2018 Plan: 
I have created a 2018 plan for People Ops to be inclusive of training needs and opportunities within the org (Manager 1.0 and 2.0, Diversity & Cultural Sensitivity, Interview Training enhancements, Spotlight Series (Manager & EE Topics Monthly), Unconscious Bias) as well as a Flash Survey Campaign that will run the course of the year to begin to get a real-time pulse on employee satisfaction and engagement. The goal is to not only lead the POps team through a fruitful and impactful 2018, but also to continue to influence teams across the company with reason, expertise, and technical mastery. We will be able to provide substantial impact on our management capabilities and employee satisfaction with these measures. Being responsible for PeopleOps OKR creation and driving them to success within the team are clear examples of operation as an L7, with overlap into L8. 

Mentorship, Leadership, Relationships: 
I have traveled to all sites to ensure that I have face time with each employee at Argo, as best as able. I have made it a priority to spend time checking in with remote managers and employees on a regular cadence, and building relationships across the organization and at all levels. Argo has a tremendous team and I feel fortunate to be able to connect with the individuals here. Certain teams required a lot of hands-on time and support, and I have been able to build these relationships and work closely with managers and senior leadership to mitigate and resolve issues. Some have resulted in off-boardings, and others in short or long term approaches to managing problems with individuals or on their teams. 

I have received tremendous feedback in this area, with a number of managers sharing their feedback with me in the following ways:

“I am so glad you are here. I wouldn’t have been able to do this without you.”
“Thank goodness for you. Thank you for supporting this.”
“I don’t know how you do it, but you do. I don’t envy your role at all, but somehow you always seem calm and handle this stuff.”
“You’ve had a lot of stuff to tackle - I don’t know where we’d be without you.”
“Thank you for spending the time to walk me through this. I’ve never really done this before and talking through it ahead of time was really helpful.”
“Thanks for taking - well all them not just one - for the team. I know these aren’t fun.”
“Really thank you for listening and offering guidance beforehand. It helped a lot!”
""You've really taken the bull by the horns and handled some tough things. So happy that you are here!""
""Thanks jen. Quite a week!""

Additionally, I have stepped up in Leadership and Core meetings to ensure that best practices are followed, and to engage in discussion and provide advice and vision on needs for the organization, particularly around People Ops functions. I am comfortable in my POps expertise to provide sound guidance to others, as well as engage in challenging conversations about organizational change and vision. I have provided substantial guidance to leadership at all levels in the areas of off-boarding, retainment, best practices for management and communication. 

Summary:
All of the above components were balanced against the rapid day-to-day needs of the org and team. I have provided strategic guidance to my own team to be able to operate effectively and efficiently, as well as to other partners in the organization. I have been a sounding board for the recruiting team for best practices in areas that cross over to People Ops, as well as guidance and direct support to leaders across the org to tackle difficult conversations, complex issues, organizational planning, development opportunities, and compliance. Much of the People Operations function, and my role in particular, involves executing against immediate needs, but also having long-range sight into initiatives and strategic improvements that will show results over time. I feel confident that the groundwork to date is pushing Argo POps toward success. As such, I am opting in for promotion consideration to move from an L6 People Operations Manager II to an L7, Senior People Operations Manager.

In a short time, Jen has been able to create a strategic & specialized POps team to better support the needs of Argo and the direction the org is moving in. This is imperative as our people are our most important asset. 
While being pulled in multiple directions at any time, Jen excels at communicating and supporting our POps team.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,report,"Jen is an excellent and thoughtful communicator and she is easy to go to for feedback or questions.  Since I've started I feel like she's led the POps team in a productive and proactive manner.  Some of the major accomplishments that I have seen from her during this review cycle are the completion and distribution of the employee handbook, the kick off of the diversity initiatives, the creation of the professional development stipend, and the overall push for workflow documentation within the POps department. With the growth of the POps team over the past couple months, she has still managed to clearly define all of our roles and support our individual and departmental growth.  ",,,Maria Beshalske,mbeshalske@argo.ai,Jen Honick,jhonick@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,report,"Jen has only been my manager for a short time, but in that time she has done a tremendous job of leading a growing team.

I resonate really well with her style of leading team meetings - she allows each of us to share a win, voice any concerns / roadblocks we've had over the week, and then she shares relevant things with the team that we may need to be thinking about. It's a very pragmatic way of running a meeting. Similarly, Jen allows me to run our 1:1s by sharing what I need to share first.

Jen empowers the team to make decisions, but let's us know she is there to help with the bigger stuff or escalate issues to her own manager/leadership when we need. ",,,Julie Menge,jmenge@argo.ai,Jen Honick,jhonick@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,report,"Jen has been a great addition to Argo and People Operations Team.  She provides much needed leadership for our department as well as facilitates better collaboration with the Operations Teams and Executive Leadership.

Jen is able to clearly define Argo’s needs and how our department needs to address them.

In her short time here she has driven several projects to completion including:

She immediately jumped on projects was able to step in and help finalize benefits compliance needs, with ACA setup and administration.

Provide long awaited manager training and coaching.

Build the POps Team and clearly identify roles.  This was sorely needed not only to help our team cover a larger scope but also to better organize tasks and make us more efficient.  Mike and I were stretched incredibly thin over a large subset of job duties, but now the structures and roles are in place to help alleviate this and create a much better workflow.

Develop and define needed performance management program and building upon that to also help finalize and implement a learning and development program to address compliance needs and set the building blocks in place to expand learning to cover managerial training needs.  

Clean up policies and procedures, helping us to more clearly define how we handle Argo provided leave compensation, rewards & recognition, and most importantly our code of conduct.  Creating the Employee Handbook and collaborating with Legal and Argo Leadership was no small task and the impact of having this for our company and employees is immense.  The Employee Handbook not only creates a solid base for how POps and Managers address situations it also sets the tone and expectations for our employees.

She continues to drive review and improvement of our procedures and processes.  

Jen also works well in collaboration with different managers and teams.  This is a clear strength of hers and her presence has created an even better relationship with the Recruiting and Finance Teams as well as our Argo Managers.  It makes me confident knowing that these teams and managers trust our People Operations Manager.  

Jen is the driver of change we sorely needed to keep our department on track and accomplishing goals rapidly.  She is incredibly knowledgeable in all human resources related areas from benefits to employee relations.  She is a leader I can see myself growing under and she makes sure she invests the time to understand my interests and works to provide me opportunities.  Jen is an asset to our company and the team.  

It is my solid opinion you will only continue to be impressed by her work and what she leads our team to accomplish in 2018.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"As I read through Jen's self evaluation, I was so impressed with all that she has accomplished in such a short time.  Jen has made a mark on Argo in such a positive way and I believe that she is the perfect choice for this position.  She is such a balanced and professional member of the team and takes her job seriously but not necessarily herself!  

In this role, I can't imagine how difficult it is to remain optimistic and positive.  She has to deal with such difficult situations, but she does so with grace and compassion.  Having lived through the team prior to her, I can say that the approach is completely different.  I think that I may be unique in that I had the unfortunate opportunity to deal with a separation with both teams.  Reflecting on both experiences, it is disturbing to me how vastly different they were...when one would think that they really should have been very similar. 

To start with, I know that Jen believes that she may not be as available as she would like, but she has been super responsive to my needs.  When dealing with the team in the past, it literally took two weeks for me to get a response regarding an inquiry regarding providing an employee a PIP.  Even after the CEO asked them to support me, as I was getting no where on my own, they still took a week to respond.  Unfortunately, when this situation came up again in my group, I reached out to Jen and she was available the same day to talk.  She quickly put together a plan and we executed providing the most opportunity for the employee to improve.

Jen was able to review the PIP documentation and help to deliver the message to the employee.  In my previous experience, I put the PIP together and did not get feedback on the information for a week and within that time the employee took two more days off and instead of going to a PIP we decided that we would go directly to a separation.  

The amount of support and the quality of support provided by Jen and her team is by far the best support that I have received from any ""HR"" type of services available.  This is saying something since I have more than 25 years of experience managing employees.  

Jen's team is responsive and professional and I believe that is a result of the example that Jen provides.  

Jen is definitely a team player and is willing to help whenever needed!  She has built a team that is the same.  Jen has lead them to accomplish great things in a very short period of time.  They have made significant changes that had been stalled prior to her arrival and implemented new services that were sorely needed.  

Even under extremely short timelines, Jen works through evaluations of products, holds them up against the needs of the org and then executes to provide services that enhance the organization.

Personally, I feel that Jen has been a great addition to this team.  She has been able to fill the gaps, and some were very large, that were haunting the organization.  She is confident, professional and most of all a very compassionate person.  She is skillful with her words and takes the time to prepare prior to important meetings.  I think that the entire leadership team stands to learn so much from Jen.  She is a great addition to the team and l look forward to continuing to work with her as a member of the leadership team!

I hate to compare Jen to the previous team leader, but there is such a stark difference, I feel that it is needed.  Jen brings a level of professionalism to this position that has been missing.  She has built a team where each member understands their role and can execute to their set of responsibilities.  She leads by example and works with the leadership team to help all of them to be successful.  She is available when you need her and she makes sure to touch base with you on a regular basis.

Jen is doing a fantastic job!",,,Kelly Mullins,kmullins@argo.ai,Jen Honick,jhonick@argo.ai,General & Administrative,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Jen's sense of ownership has really stood out and had high impact during her short time at Argo. 

For example, prior to her involvement there was limited direction within some departments on what their org structure should look like and the # / level of roles they were approved to hire during the year. Therefore, the recruiting team was given limited guidance and there was a lack of alignment between executive expectations and team growth.

Jen jumped in an took ownership over working with the team leads to develop well thought out and structured org plans, defining the right # of people managers to ICs by team. In particular, when there is attrition, she works with the leads to understand how the open role should be filled - if it makes sense to rescope the role to fit any changes in needs of the team or perform a straight backfill. This has been an ongoing struggle particularly in the SW department and Jen's ability to plug in and drive conversations / decisions forward has increased the speed of the decision to execution process.",,,Jen DeBrincat,jdebrincat@argo.ai,Jen Honick,jhonick@argo.ai,General & Administrative,

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"Process Vetting Across Org: 
Upon setting up the Traliant LMS system for Anti-Harassment training, I did not fully vet the internal requirements and failed to complete the full IT review prior to engaging the platform. As a result, we did not have Single Sign On (SSO) set up at launch. We have since rectified this. It was a learning experience for me to ensure that I am well-versed on internal expectations before moving forward with new vendors, as well as to ask critical and leading questions around best practices already established. 

Proactive & Strategic Team: 
A goal, and an area of opportunity and growth for me is to continue to push for the team to become more proactive (less reactive on the day-to-day) and to effectively delegate work to the team. This will allow me to engage my time in more strategic initiatives with high impact on the organization. Time management while the team has grown has been a challenge for me, but am starting to see more balance with the team (mostly) in place. I would like to provide strategic plans for Argo, with additional long-term gains, as opposed to continuing to put out fires. 

OKRs:
I believe there is opportunity for me to become more connected to the long term business plan and develop strategic vision for how POps can support the org throughout different growth and dev phases. While we've achieved some of this, I would like to see it move from high level to more detailed, and directly impacting each team in the org with respect to company OKRs. 

Responsiveness: 
There is an opportunity for me to better balance my time for less urgent needs. In retrospect, there have been some emails or asks that have lagged for a week or more, which in my opinion, is not acceptable. It is both necessary and advantageous for my role to be as responsive as possible and to ensure that all questions / asks are addressed in the most timely manner possible.

Jen has made so much positive change just in being here for a short period of time, I truly feel as though she’s driven projects to completion quickly and with understanding of the overall department capacity and needs.  She’s made a lot of great changes and put a lot of time and effort developing and defining the roles with People Operations and I’m excited to see what these roles under her leadership can do. 

I’d like to see her continue to push our department to grow in scope and what we offer employees at Argo.  Further solidify our relationships and how we communicate with other departments within Argo as well as Managers.  Having a lapse in POps leadership did do some damage in how the company utilizes us a support and I’d like to see Jen continue to rebuild our department’s standing with the company.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"During my first six months at Argo, I have been able to adapt to a new industry, become more familiar with the field of finance and accounting, and have learned several new systems and workflows in a relatively short period of time. I’ve shown my ability to work well in teams, as well as my ability to take the initiative to complete and follow through on complex projects, all while simultaneously completing multiple daily, weekly, and monthly tasks.

My tasks require many ongoing responsibilities on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. I have done an excellent job at completing these responsibilities on time and with great attention to detail. My daily, weekly, and monthly tasks include the following:
          - On-board and off-board all employee account information for new hires into 
             and out of our financial systems, Netsuite and Concur, and ensure employees have 
             the information needed for setting up their Concur account. 
          - Manage and monitor our accounts payable ticketing system, FreshService. 
             Download an average of 30-40 invoices per day and correspond with vendors
          - Enter an average of 150 invoices per week.
          - Review and approve an average of 180 expense reports per month. Scrub all 
             expense lines for accurate coding, receipts, and fraud.
          - Prepare fitness reimbursements for Payroll to process.
          - Process all candidate reimbursements.
          - Manage our corporate credit card program, by ordering cards and handling 
            fraud.
         - Answer employee questions regarding expense reports and travel arrangements 
            in a timely manner

On top of keeping up with these ongoing tasks, I have also been able to manage and complete several long-term projects that have benefited Argo as a whole. The first project I was able to accomplish was the implementation of our lease administration software Spacebase. 

Spacebase
When I started, Argo did not have a software program that managed their leases. I was tasked with finding a lease administration software package. After researching several software programs, scheduling calls and demos, negotiating prices, and getting feedback from multiple teams, we decided to go with Spacebase. Spacebase not only offered a cost effective solution for organizing our real estate portfolio, they were also able to abstract all of our property leases in a thorough and time efficient manner.

The result of Spacebase’s implementation has been very successful. Users receive weekly email notifications regarding payment due dates, critical date reminders, and upcoming changes. We are able to report on payment schedules, capacity, and other key information needed by real estate, finance, legal, and facilities. Before Spacebase, finding critical information was difficult. Now we can find all lease related information easily and immediately. 

Concur
As one of the Concur administrators, I manage and maintain the system. I am constantly seeking ways to improve, upgrade, and optimize Concur to make our expense report process more efficient.

With the implementation of project codes to better analyze our data and forecast budgets, a substantial change to Concur was required. All project codes needed to be created in Concur, which required customized configuration to the system. This modification required bringing together many moving parts. 

In order to complete this, I worked with Concur representatives to structure, configure, and customize the system to meet our needs. I helped organize the workflow process and protocols, so that accurate coding was ensured.

Since coding expenses drastically changed, I created a coding guide for all employees to follow and made it available in Confluence. When I made this guide, I considered the audience and users and made it as easy as possible to understand and use.The Concur coding guide has been a success. Employees have been correctly coding their expenses and have had a lot less questions regarding the process. Having a formal structure with clear instructions for submitting expenses has been a significant improvement for employees and administrators. 

Credit Card Clean-Up
I was involved with the initiative to lower our financial risk by reevaluating Argo’s credit card eligibility criteria. When Argo was a smaller company, all employees received a company credit card upon hire. After careful consideration and review from finance and procurement, it was decided to scale back credit card holders, and only allow a small group of eligible employees to have a company credit card.

My role involved coordinating several tasks that resulted in an easy and efficient outcome for the project. An initial email explaining our new credit card policy was sent to all managers. I then collaborated with our managers to review their direct reports to determine if their direct reports were eligible for a company credit card. 

Once I knew who did and did not meet the criteria, I completed the deactivation of over 80 credit cards. Furthermore, I had to communicate this new policy by sending an email to employees notifying them that their card would be deactivated and explaining the process for safely disposing of their credit card. 

This project required mindful communication to managers, as well as employees. I also took careful consideration to ensure that any prior arrangements employees may have made, such as travel, were not affected. 

Reimbursement Processing
As a member of the finance team, I have been involved in collaborating with People Ops for payment processing of reimbursements. I have been involved in the brainstorming process to help create a more structured and efficient reimbursement process. An important outcome of this has been simplifying the administrative tasks. For example, fitness reimbursements were originally submitted once a month. Now, employees submit receipts twice a year (unless changes occur), which has dramatically cut down on process time for both employees and myself. Employees find our new reimbursement process easy and intuitive.

Celigo Integration
I helped complete integrating ADP data into Netsuite using Celigo. The project of integrating ADP and Netsuite required troubleshooting many issues and reconciling data files. The completion of this process has not only improved our data accuracy and integrity, but has also reduced our process time.

Collaboration
I enjoy collaborating with others and always try to bring a positive, willing, and helpful attitude. I consistently seek input from my colleagues for ways to improve my performance. So my team can accomplish its goals, I frequently take on more work. 

I constantly seek ways to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the projects I work on. I adapt to change and accommodate moving deadlines. I’m eager to learn new things in order to find solutions and improvements. As A/P’s volume has increased, I have taken on more responsibilities, such as managing FreshService, processing more invoices, providing end-of-month accrual data, and communicating with vendors.

I have also completed an Introduction to Accounting class in order to strengthen my understanding and knowledge of accounting principles and concepts.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,manager,,,,Lilli Cannon,lcannon@argo.ai,Jenna Goldby,jgoldby@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Jenna is thoughtful, easy to approach, and welcoming to questions and feedback. In the team meetings I've attended with her, she has been positive and engaged, and highly collaborative. For these reasons and more, she is a wonderful teammate and a great fit for the open and honest culture we have at Argo.

In March, Jenna and I collaborated on written communication of the corporate credit card policy. While this was a relatively small project, what stood out in this instance and others is that Jenna works well in teams and uses resources/peer input to bring projects to the next level.  Jenna sent me her initial ideas (a draft email), discussed solutions to challenges (in a 1:1 meeting), and together we came up with a logical path forward (review of revisions & final plan). I admire that she reaches out for feedback and is open and receptive to suggestions. Her desire to collaborate really makes her work stronger and utilizes the various skill sets we have on the finance team - to everyone's advantage.

In January, Jenna wrote a guide to help others understand the new project codes the accounting team began rolling out in Q4. She took this work home over the course of a few days to put additional hours into it, and was really thoughtful in ensuring it was the best it could be. This guide is organized well, with an intuitive flow and a clear, concise explanation of how to code various expenses. It is a huge step up from the slide deck the team originally had in place; it's user-friendly and provides enough detail to be of help without overwhelming the reader. Jenna's ability to pare down the information -- and structure the coding guide in such a way that it conveys information clearly -- demonstrates substantial understanding of the domain and an ability to effectively communicate to a wide audience.

Jenna's ability to synthesize and convey information is critical to her role as someone who regularly communicates with employees and teams across the company (i.e. People Operations, Recruiting, individuals with issues that need to be corrected on expense reports, etc.). This skill is a key strength to have on the accounting team, and really compliments those who may bring more technical finance/accounting backgrounds. ",,,Isobel King,iking@argo.ai,Jenna Goldby,jgoldby@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Jenna has been a great resource to pair with on many different projects. Jenna and I have worked closely on building out the processes for benefit programs that have a finance component. Jenna has a great outlook on building processes, she constantly thinks of the employee and how user friendly the process is. Jenna and I have worked on building a processes for the Fitness Reimbursement and Professional Development Reimbursement Programs. Jenna is a great person to pair with on building processes because she steps out of her own role/area of expertise. Jenna has the great ability to view the entire process, make holistic decisions and then build her own tasks to match the process. Jenna is great at simplifying processes, for example: The fitness reimbursement was formerly submitted monthly. Jenna and I worked together to have the submission cut down to every 6 months, which decreases the amount of work for all parties involved.   Jenna also makes sure these process submissions are private and secure, which is greatly helpful for our employees. 

Jenna also acts as a great resource for employees for any Concur and reimbursement questions. There have been many times where Jenna has stepped in to help a new hire or guide someone through concur, which I really appreciate. She is great at guiding people through processes and is always attentive and thorough. ",,,Mike Fitzpatrick,mfitzpatrick@argo.ai,Jenna Goldby,jgoldby@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Jenna's enthusiastically takes on new challenges - her willingness and drive to take on learning experiences is one of her biggest strengths.

For example, after I identified the need to track lease contracts and key terms, Jenna researched multiple systems, worked on negotiating the contract pricing, and implemented (and continues to manage) the Spacebase tool. This tool has been helpful in quickly identifying key terms for moving out of Crane / when payment increases are required / flagging expiring TIA periods / etc. This is not typically a system or process managed by the finance team but Jenna's enthusiasm to step up when no one else was there to drive this process has had company wide impact",,,Jen DeBrincat,jdebrincat@argo.ai,Jenna Goldby,jgoldby@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Jenna started with the accounting and finance team in October and was a welcomed addition to the team.  She was able to learn NetSuite, which was not a system she had previously been familiar with, and in doing so she has found ways to track our stats in AP, which we are going to build on in the upcoming months.  I have been able to entrust Jenna with a lot of AP responsibility.  She now maintains our ticketing system, which can see anywhere from 20-50 invoices come through per day.  She also independently enters invoices with minimal error and follows-up on any discrepancies with procurement or outside vendors.  I can trust Jenna to effectively communicate with vendors to work through ambiguous invoices, and to follow-up until there is resolution.
Jenna has also taken on the majority, if not all, of Concur responsibility.  As it relates to Concur, Jenna processes out of pocket reimbursements, which come through NetSuite as open vendor bills.  In a timely fashion, Jenna emails Lilliian Cannon and me to let us know, so that Lilli can provide the bank detail for me to record payment in NetSuite.  Whenever there are discrepancies between what has hit the bank and what has hit NetSuite, Jenna is able to verify that the difference identified is due to one or more reports that are being held up in Concur, and she is able to work through them to make sure they are processed shortly thereafter, and do not hold up any month-end processes, which is extremely helpful.  By becoming a subject matter expert on Concur, she was also able to come up with much better reporting than we previously had, in order to do a more accurate month-end Concur accrual with various coding aspects.
In addition to the Concur month-end accrual, Jenna also has the time-consuming task of processing all Concur credit card transactions (which can amount to 100 or more at month-end), which come to NetSuite in the form of pending vendor bills.  Jenna works through all of these to submit and approve them, making sure they are all hitting the appropriate accounting period, which allows me to record the payment timely at month-end.  Jenna also does the coding for the AP accrual at month-end.  This includes coding 4 different codes per line and breaking up invoices.  Ultimately she is coding upwards of 100 lines at month-end.  Her continued help with this effort has allowed me to review the AP accrual with little revision.
AP volume has increased drastically since Jenna started at Argo.  Her dedication and hard work have helped us to get through a backlog of invoices, when I was consumed with the PwC audit, and Jenna was doing the bulk of AP entering while I reviewed.  Jenna has been instrumental in keeping up with invoicing, and she continues to make a positive impact on our team.
While doing all of this, Jenna has also implemented Spacebase amongst other projects, which has given the team visibility in to all of our leases in one place.  As Argo continues to grow this will become even more of a vital resource.
It has been a pleasure to work so closely with Jenna in the realm of accounts payable, and she continues to have a positive impact on the accounting and finance team.",,,Emily Ruscetti,eruscetti@argo.ai,Jenna Goldby,jgoldby@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Jenna brings creativity (information synthesis and communication) and the technical aptitude that's required for this role (i.e. integrating ADP data into Netsuite, updating purchasing codes, etc.). In conversation, Jenna has expressed a desire to build up her general knowledge of accounting, and I really admire her for this. Her completion of an Introduction to Accounting class and the projects she has taken on over her time at Argo, speak well to the commitment she has made to continuous learning. It would be great to see her take on more courses/seminars/conferences to grow her technical skills (i.e. building up to more advanced use of Google Sheets), if accounting is the field/track that she desires to take on more responsibility in.

        my first candidate decline which stung a little bit.

**January:** 
Sudip Roy – Offer Rescinded due to immigration
     •	Sudip is a T5 Research Scientist at Google where he worked on the backend data 
        systems which served the entirety of Google’s important Machine Learning systems in 
        the Tensorflow Data Team. 
     •	Unfortunately, he was our first candidate who could not be hired due to immigration 
         constraints. 
Mingxiao Yang – Hired
     •	Mingxiao was hired as a T4 in LiDAR. He is a Laser Design specialist from TRUMPF who 
         holds a MS from Rochester. 
Philippe Boutrefroy – Offer Rescinded due to potential risk as a lead
     •	Philippe is an L6 Principal Engineer from NVIDIA Autonomous.  This was a bit of a Gbin 
        disaster. During the debrief, there was a clear decision for “yes.” We wanted to move 
        forward with him as an L6 and Gbin wanted to “give him the chance to lead the team” 
        or let him remain as an L6, whichever crystallized. Gbin had a sell call to speak with 
        Philippe about this. He was fairly sold on the idea but Brett was not supportive which 
        lead to a breakdown in the hire. 
Adel Ahmadyan – Offer Rescinded due to immigration.
     •	Adel is a PhD from Urbana-Chamaign and most recently has been working on a small 
        CV team at SNAP. He blew our interviewers away with his algorithmic skills, correctly & 
        efficiently solving problems he had never seen before. Due to his nationality and 
        unexpected constraints, he became our second candidate who could not be hired due 
        to immigration. 

**February:**

        ability, growth potential and offer review happening during the headcount constriction.

**March:** 
Tanmay Shah – “Yes” from Debrief. 
     •	Tanmay is a Computer Vision Engineer from SNAP & Qualcomm.
     •	With lessons learned from Xiangfei, Rita was able to support his candidacy and move 
         the process forward during offer review, however it came with the unfortunate timing 
        of headcount constriction. Like Xiangfei, he indicated he planned to accept an offer 
        with Google Vision, which he considered a backup to Argo.
Abhijit Kundu – “Yes” from Debrief 
     •	Abhijit was referred by James has as the top Vision PhD student at Georgia Tech. 
     •	We declined to move forward during the headcount shift because of his inexperience 
         as a new grad. James called him the “one of the best students on campus.” He is 
         likely to join Oculus or NVIDIA 
Yahia Tachwali - Hired

**BREAKDOWN; LiDAR DSP Search:**

LiDAR has been very consistent overall, however the challenges it presents are not only the geographic restrictions to NJ but several of the managers are somewhat green. I’d like to highlight a specific significant win with Sam Wilton on the Statistical DSP Engineer role because the way I worked through it with him is an accomplishment I felt very proud of:

Sam is a fairly green hiring manager. While he does have a clear idea of what he is looking for,  he doesn’t have a strong understanding of what the talent market looks like.  He is also a bit gun-shy because of poor hires in the past.  

On the “Statistical DSP” role, we began the search with an exclusive focus on hiring candidates who possessed Geiger-Mode Experience. After interviewing a number of them, we realized they didn’t bring anything new to the table and lacked the engineering fundamentals we were looking for. They were MATLAB scientists but we were looking for DSP & FPGA implementation, which is a very rare combination.  

We then began interviewing some of the more traditional DSP engineers who had strong statistical training and algorithmic savvy while also being strong engineers. After going through a large number of them, we realized they weren’t a good target because their statistical algorithms were just too different from what we needed & too similar to hires from the past who had not worked out.

During this time, I spoke at length with Sam about the nature of the engineering problem LiDAR needed to solve with this hire during our one on ones. Thankfully Sam is a great communicator and through those conversations, I developed an understanding of the algorithmic needs of the role & why neither talent market was working for him.

Once I understood the problem, I began to research algorithms which might be a fit. I found a family of algorithms called “Compressed Sensing,” which neither Sam nor I had previously heard of. While it wasn’t the exact Geiger mode science, we imagined that candidates with Compressed Sensing would have their minds in the right statistical algorithm mindset.

After honing in on that, we soon had the fortune of being able to choose between Yahia Tachwali & Alon Kipnis, both of whom we were very excited about.  We settled on Yahia because of his engineering fundamentals, algorithmic savvy and experience delivering many products in the past.

I’m currently working through a similar process to fill Sam’s LiDAR simulation role where after much digging, discovery and research, we have begun to find a few seemingly promising candidates. One of which is on-site today.

**BREAKDOWN; Adapting with the changing business needs of Perception:**

The only 2 consistent Aspects in the Perception Team are Michael Happold and change. Here is a recap of how the organization has shifted and how I’ve adapted with changing business needs:

In my first months in Perception, we practiced pipeline recruiting with the instruction of Guillaume Bine. Michael Happold was involved as a subject matter expert to ensure resumes were calibrated and suggest potential allocation. During this time, Rita & Rob were still the leaders in Localization & Calibration.  

The model was not working. While we were conducting heavy interview volume & the profile feedback was “the best pipeline of candidates we’ve ever had,” hires were not popping out. It was beginning to be a strong concern considering the candidate volume & seemingly calibrated candidates.

I was beginning to realize that selected interview panels and role docs from Gbin might not be properly calibrated to candidates. A specific example was Matineh Shekhar. She was a Machine Learning specialist who was interested in Prediction. Despite my communication of this to Gbin prior to the interview and reinforcing it on the day of the interview, she communicated to me that she was very upset that her interview panel mostly asked her about computer vision & didn’t quite get the full signal on her Machine Learning skills. 

At that point, I began working with Kyle to pull together a Data on passthrough rates & candidate volume so that I could so that I could deliver a post-mortem report on the pipeline to Gbin & debug what was going on. 

However, that was right as we entered code red and Brett took stewardship of Perception Hiring. (This was about the time in that I was visibly stressed about the perception pipeline and we sat down for a chat about it at Smallman.)

Shortly after the re-org, under Brett’s direction, we were able to have a breakthrough month in hires with 3 in February. Those included Tao Fu for Calibration, Gang Pan for Localization and Kimish Patel for ML-Infra.

Going into March, it appeared that the momentum would continue as we were ready to make offers to Abhijit Kundu & Tanmay Shah. However, this is when headcount hiring focused shifted and both candidates were removed from consideration.

This is also when Ersin came in to lead Detection. He made it very clear that he was interested in only 2 types of hires: Bar-Raisers and Diverse Females.

To ensure that future candidates were well fit to his needs, I developed a collaborative executive search document which outlines relevant information on target candidates with Ersin. We have collaborated together in outreach to them and have put together a strong pipeline of well qualified candidates with 4 on-sites slated this month & many more in the process behind them.

The document can be found here:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_ygxGU9GXo7a_VZjh3SIlpsFVDg2l4JtnEdN2ZSqWOU/edit#gid=0

One of my favorite perception accomplishments is learning from the above search-collaboration with Ersin and extending the collaborative exec-search document approach to the Geometric Vision Lead search. Zach and I had been struggling to come up with strong GeoCV leaders. Realizing we needed a different strategy, I partnered with Brett to develop a search list from Professors who specialize in the GeoCV world.

Starting there, I mapped out a list with 118 potential targets, the vast majority of which have heard from the recruiting team but had been unresponsive.  

The current results have been 10 candidates speaking with us, which is a drastic change from the 1-3 non-fits that Zach and I were able to produce on our own.

_______________________________________________________________________

**BREAKDOWN; Untangling the hiring knot for Calibration:**

One of the major efforts was in recruiting for calibration which had a number of challenges to untangle as we dug into it. Here is how we were able to untangle the knot in Calibration to make hires: 

Selling Candidates on Calibration: 

The Calibration search started with Rita painting Calibration work in a negative light.  Rita did not feel the Calibration role was a very attractive job & that vision candidates would reject the team in the current pipeline process in favor of other options (which they did). We needed a dialog to sell candidates on why the Calibration team was technically interesting & that they should join it. 

What I found on my own was that the Calibration team was very attractive to the right people when it was presented as a complex sensor fusion environment that had to deal with the reality of a very large active fleet of vehicles & their inherent challenges. 

The Candidate Pool: 

The initial searches began as pipeline based for computer vision & working to sell Calibration/Tracking/Localization as a set of teams to choose from & candidates were almost universally selecting Localization/Tracking over Calibration.

Beyond that, candidates who were heavy in Geometric Vision were not showing much interest in calibration. As the search continued, I was able to hone in on candidates who were heavy in image processing and photogrammetry as ideal candidates for the calibration team if they didn’t have prior calibration experience which resulted in the final pipelines which yielded Xiangfei, Tao & Tanmay.


The Front-End Interview Process:

The initial pipeline model was not working not only because of candidates having more interest in Localization & Tracking but also because interview panels were ruling out candidates that Rita was excited about at a high rate. When she said “They don’t have to know those details that Xiaoyan asked,” we moved forward with making adjustments.  This was about when the re-org happened.  Rita and I partnered to reconstruct interview panels which would give calibration candidates a better fighting chance.

The Back-End Hiring Process: 

The first candidate who broke through after making adjustments was Xiangfei Qian. Rita wanted to hire him for the team during debrief with confidence. The offer request had Gbin CC’d as the HM, which occurred during Code Red. 
When questions about the packet were raised, I tried to loop in both Gbin and Rita to support the candidate. GBin was silent due to Code Red & Rita expressed frustration but was unwilling to jump into a thread in which she was not copied. 

Learning from that, we ensured that Rita was CC’d on both Tao and Tanmay’s offer requests. While Tao was approved without difficulty, Rita was able to chime in and provide the case for Tanmay & overcome questions. While it came with unfortunate timing during the head-count constriction and we ultimately didn’t move forward with Tanmay because of headcount constrictions.

Through overcoming these challenges, I’ve honed in on how to attract the right talent for Calibration, how to sell the opportunity in an attractive way & how to better drive the process in making hires for the team.

Jeremy has a wealth of connections that he mines and has actively sought to expand them. He seeks to learn more about the various sub-fields of perception to improve his own filtering of candidates, which has a beneficial effect down the line by minimizing the time we spend on possible non-starters. Jeremy's communication skills are excellent and he seeks to keep in constant contact with the team leaders with whom he is working.",,,Michael Happold,mhappold@argo.ai,Jeremy Mundell,jmundell@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Jeremy has done an excellent job recruiting for the LiDAR team since he joined Argo in November.  He has come up to speed quickly in understanding the needs of our team, and he has been instrumental in landing the half a dozen great hires we’ve made since January and developing the extensive pipeline in place for the next half dozen.

- Jeremy has worked extremely diligently to understand the underlying technology of the various LiDAR sub-system teams.  He came in with impressive knowledge of the electronics industry, which is highly relevant to a significant subset of the LiDAR team’s activity, and he has rapidly come up to speed in areas that are newer to him, like optics and mechanical engineering.  He works hard to ensure that he has understood the needs of hiring managers and tests his understanding by pushing for sufficient feedback on resumes he sources and frequent 1:1 discussions to confirm alignment on those needs.
- He has been instrumental in landing the half a dozen hires we’ve made in LiDAR since January with a deep and active pipeline currently in process for another half dozen positions we’re aiming to fill.
- Jeremy has established a good rapport with all of the hiring managers in LiDAR, and he has productively sought my help in the few instances in which he wasn’t getting sufficiently timely or informative feedback.  He has always maintained a great attitude about working through those few situations where managers were not responsive enough, with an understanding that his greatest impact for the LiDAR team was going to come from focusing on our most critical hires even if those were not the easiest.
- Jeremy’s insight into our role definitions has been very helpful, particularly in cases where our definition has likely been too ambitious and our needs would be more appropriately met by splitting a single (possibly over-reaching) role into two positions.
- Jeremy's diligence is admirable:  he's available at all hours, he's incredibly responsive about reaching out to candidates and solving potential issues with scheduling, and he exhibits dedicated ownership in the entire recruiting process.
- His enthusiasm for his recruiting function is phenomenal:  he exhibits sincere excitement over finding a candidate that looks like a good fit, and he is genuinely thrilled as he gets through the process of closing on a great hire.
- It is clear that candidates are impressed by working with Jeremy, and I have had several candidates tell me that their discussions with him have been the best interactions they’ve ever had with a recruiter.  In this respect, Jeremy is a great ambassador for Argo!
",,,Mark Itzler,mitzler@argo.ai,Jeremy Mundell,jmundell@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Jeremey has been a great asset to our recruiting team since joining Argo in early November. I feel like it took him a few months to pick up speed but early in January of 2018 I am not uncertain that he seemed to catch his stride and he has made three impacts on Argo.ai and myself that I think warrant’s a 3 grade. 


Strengths: 
1. Argo LiDAR: I felt that the acquisition of Princeton Lightwave was a game changer for our company but we would only go as far as the team we built to support them. I feel like Jeremy took the reigns and really lead the charge in the recruitment of that team which is a team that is in a challenging niche. I believe he has made over 6-10 (Not sure of the exact number) of hires on Argo LiDAR which I believe has impacted the pace in which that team is moving. I feel like a recruiter doing a 2 grade in that job would just go after key words and glaze over the details but JM spent the time to learn, strategize and as LiDAR seems to be a growing part of our business having someone we can call an expert recruiter in that field brings in a tremendous amount of value. 

2. Executive Recruiting: In Q1/Q2 of this year the team was hit with new hiring mandates. Hire L6 Engineers and hire L7 Managers to lead our teams. Jeremy took it upon himself to approach this style of recruiting in a different way that I think has showed results. He researched and found the top minds in perception and got their contact information to give to hiring managers (Ersin, Peter, Deva) and the hiring managers reached out. As the GEO/CV lead is one of the most challenging roles at Argo I don’t believe we have made a hire but to date I know we have some heavy hitters in the pipeline. As many people on our island know I have good hearing I have heard compliments from people like Peter Carr about his strategy. Overall this is a long game strategy that in my gut I feel like will pay dividends at the end of the road. 

3. My Personal Growth: What excites me about Argo is the opportunity to learn from people who I consider at the top of the game. Throughout my young career at so far people have tried to “train” me in the art of recruitment but I felt like I got to the point where I was not  building a base or building tools to make me successful long term. In the first few weeks JM invited me to sit in on one of his early calls, and we set up a 1 on 1 where we went over recruiting tactics. JM has the unique ability to help someone like myself incorporate aspects of his style without forcing it and making it seem natural. Today the approach I take to sourcing here in 2018 is vastly different than a year ago and I think that it is working in terms of getting responses and interest. Overall my point is, he is a good teacher/coach and someone who can help take something that I can find complex (Aspects of Machine learning) and break it down to where it makes sense for me and where I am able to use what I learned in conversations with candidates.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,,,,Zack Katic,zkatic@argo.ai,Jeremy Mundell,jmundell@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"What are some specific accomplishments, projects, and results that this person drove during the review cycle timeframe?

Jeremy hit the ground running with a lot of enthusiasm to get started on a pipeline for his requisitions. From the moment he started at Argo he had many candidates coming in for calls and on-sites and it was clear that he wanted to close as many of his open jobs as possible. His enthusiasm for recruiting and his knowledge of the roles are fantastic. 

What are areas where this person has grown and made improvements?

Jeremy does a great job of communicating with candidates. He has a personal style when communicating over email. At times his communication style with me, concerning work related tasks has been abrupt and carries a condescending tone. I have spoken to Jeremy directly about this and he has made efforts to be more aware of how he comes across over electronic communication. I think it is still a work in progress and at times I still experience moments where I feel the tone in which he communicates could be revisited. 

Think about not only results, but also about how this person collaborates and works with others.

Aside from the feedback given in the previous question, I like Jeremy's energy and enthusiasm for his job. Jeremy puts in a lot of effort to keep hiring managers in the loop. It is not clear to me in which capacity he has teamed up with Zack or Randy but when he is recruiting on a shared role, I see that he keeps them informed. 

I notice that Jeremy works well with hiring managers and candidates. I would like to see him put the same effort in working with all the RC's. There are times where certain process has been discussed and it appears that he either doesn't want to follow that process or doesn't find it as important to the rest of the group. 

At times, I am unsure of what side of Jeremy I am going to get. We do not work in the same office but his communications will show his emotions and I think its best to be consistent and be professional. 

Jeremy has a lot of great energy to share and that would be more apparent if he worked in these areas within the team.

Jeremy is well versed in the positions he is recruiting for and see him as a valuable resource when I need to answer a question to a candidate. 

Jeremy takes a personal approach when speaking to candidates.

Jeremy takes time to give me a backstory to candidates or interview situations so that on my end I can work better with the candidate or interview panel. (sensitivity to offers in hand, vacations, time constraints)

When Jeremy's energy is high, we work really well together. Tasks seem to get done with ease and any obstacles we might encounter get resolved quickly. 

Jeremy is 99.9% available at any given time over email and slack. I appreciate his responsiveness to my questions. 

Our 1:1's are productive because we keep each other informed as necessary and continue the recruiting cycle going strong. 

",,,Lorena Villegas,lvillegas@argo.ai,Jeremy Mundell,jmundell@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"
The core areas for improvement that I can most clearly see come from spending the last few years in sourcing roles and going back into a full cycle recruiter role after time away. 

I want to specifically improve my ability to influence positive outcomes in a few specific ways:


**Ensuring quality control for interview process:** 

      Early on, there was a challenge as I was ramping up. I hadn’t developed a habit of reviewing upcoming on-sites to ensure that role-docs had been put together and sent to the interview-team. After receiving feedback about this, Lorena and I made a concerted effort to fix all interviews going forward. While the problem is largely fixed, I am currently working on taking it to the next level with pre-briefs. I have scheduled my first pre-brief for Gary Kamerman in the LiDAR team tomorrow morning at 9am. 
     Outside of that, I have begun working with managers to put together generalized role docs for each specific search with pre-identified interview panels, alternate interviewers, & interview roles as they’re writing their job descriptions so that it’s less time consuming for them to deliver individualized role-docs on time for interviews.

**Increasing my ability to influence the hiring process:**
     
      As highlighted in the accomplishments section, Xiangfei Qian was a particularly strong learning lesson for me because when Rita was not CC’d on his offer request and Code Red caused a communication breakdown with Gbin, we ended up not hiring someone who ultimately went to Google Computer Vision. I think that was a blind spot for me because I was both new to Argo but also because I had been in sourcing focused roles recently. I’ve taken that point as an indicator to keep my eyes open to other areas where I can work toward influencing outcomes to a more positive end. 

     For example: Mark Owens submitted a fairly glowing scorecard on a candidate but recommended a second screen because of factors which did not make sense based on the parameters of the search which he had communicated to me and were the basis of the candidate’s candidacy (the fact that the candidate is a MTV local). 

      I asked him to clarify around this via slack but he didn’t respond. There were other outstanding issues so I scheduled a 1-1 with him that day to work through a few issues, including this one. During the conversation, I pushed back and asked the question if we had found a technical concern which merits a second screen. When phased like this, he agreed and recommended that we should move forward with an on-site. 

 Another example would be working with Sam Wilton: Sam seems to have a very clear idea of what he wants but it doesn’t really match the market reality. While I have worked toward leveraging Mark Itzler’s influence to improve the dynamics of the Simulation search, I do wonder if I could have done more with regard to influencing his expectations to more closely match what the market bears.

      One last thing I’ve not been able to accomplish yet is turning a “no” into a “hire.” This is the type of activity I would like to strive toward.


**One area I will be starting with is Interview prep:**
      
    I would like to get into the habit of conducting more interview prep with both candidates and hiring teams. In addition to the role-doc, I feel the pre-brief is a great idea and have scheduled my first one. On the candidate side, I feel that conducting interview-prep calls is a way that I can influence the positive outcome of more interviews and wonder if it were practiced earlier, if we might have more hires today.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"It is going to be difficult to improve the mining of candidates given the intense competition for qualified people. I encourage Jeremy to expand his international contacts even though we will sometimes have trouble bringing them in. With the explosion of deep learning, other areas of perception have fewer people interested, so it will take deep mining to find them (I am thinking of Geometric CV). Jeremy should familiarize himself more with this field and where the quality hides. Also (again realizing the difficulty), I would love to see us pry people away from competitors like Aurora, Zoox, etc. Some of these organizations have managed to accumulate significant talent, particularly Aurora, in spite of having a dubious business model. I would like to see Jeremy succeed in getting a couple candidates from these types of competitors in house (he has managed with Tesla, but Aurora has a deeper bench). I would also like to see an effort to mine non-traditional sources, for example from the world of physics. Peter Carr has done this well; physicists tend to be strong mathematically but have a practical outlook as well.",,,Michael Happold,mhappold@argo.ai,Jeremy Mundell,jmundell@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Jeremy has already grown in his technical knowledge of the numerous engineering disciplines represented on the LiDAR team.  Our team’s domains are particularly broad since they span both hardware and software, and the hardware domains cover a very deep vertical hierarchy spanning (i) fundamental semiconductor materials science and device design, (ii) device packaging and assembly process engineering, (iii) hardware integration including optical, mechanical, and electrical engineering disciplines, and (iv) LiDAR system-level domains including architecture, simulation, and testing.  He will continue to grow as we pursue additional hires with new expertise that we need to add to the team such as reliability, manufacturing, and more forward-looking R&D engineering roles.

Jeremy will continue to improve his interaction with the hiring managers as he further optimizes the balance of 1:1 meetings -- he is always respectful of the demands on their time -- with other techniques for eliciting the feedback he needs, e.g., concerning resumes he is sourcing for a new position.  Just this week, he is in NJ for the first time for almost the entire week, and this face-to-face interaction is sure to facilitate even stronger collaboration and teamwork in the hiring process.  Having him visit with the team at least once a quarter will be highly beneficial.
",,,Mark Itzler,mitzler@argo.ai,Jeremy Mundell,jmundell@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"1. Work Life: JM is a hard worker no doubt but he is someone who puts a lot of on his back so I would say know when to turn it on and when to turn it off.  Just making sure he uses PTO to go on vacation or relax. It’s a long journey to the promised land and I don’t want to see him burned out in year 3 or year 4 near IPO time when it will be all hands on deck. 

2. Command: JM’s got the recruiting tools piece down (as referenced in areas of strength) and I think the next step is taking command of the room during debriefs and putting his influence into the outcomes. I always felt like the advantage of recruiters is that we deal with people all day, and human interaction is our expertise. When we reach out to candidates we gamble our time and energy and like professional gamblers we analyze our candidates on everything from strengths to weaknesses and our job is to bet on the winners and so when you have put that much energy into a candidate you see things that HM’s don’t see and are not trained to see. If your candidate is between an L5 or L6 you know what he/she is and I would keep pressing your expertise and influence to direct the outcome because your job is to spot a winner.

3. You have already gotten better at this but just when someone calls in if you are able to take the call walking vs at your desk as your voice carries sometimes (But lets get real we can all be loud at times haha especially me so yeah)


Overall I consider JM our CIA Black Ops/ Ghost Recon Wild lands where we can send him into unchartered territories and smoothly takes care of business. He is certainly someone I am glad is on our side here at Argo and not at our competitors. I am not uncertain that he will continue to be successful here at Argo.

Jeremy can improve on creating better working relationships with the other RC's whom I lean on for support if I'm ever out of the office. Jeremy can continue to improve his communication style over slack and email.  
Jeremy should continue to work on following process that has been put in place.  There are times I would like to offer a simple solution to our emails and will receive pushback. I want Jeremy to feel comfortable with making small but impactful changes so that our working relationship runs smoother. 

What are some projects where this person could have done better?Think about not only results, but also about how this person collaborates and works with others.

There are times when certain projects such as the job descriptions overhaul was explained in team meetings and it appeared that Jeremy was going to let me take the lead on a lot of the responsibility rather than collaborate. Toward the final phase of the project and through feedback I feel that he improved in collaborating with me to get the job done. In communicating that I felt we needed to work together, there was some pushback which quickly went away when I mentioned that someone above me was going to review these results. I would like in the future to feel confident that he understand the importance of why I am looping him in rather than feel I need to push by mentioning someone else's name.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"For the last several months I have been wearing a few different hats. I have been the Team Lead for the Recruiting Coordinators, Recruiting Coordinator supporting Sarah Pasquarelli and the Hardware Team, and supporting the summer intern program. 

As a Team Lead, I see myself as a resource and go-to person for my team. I work with my team to create and standardize process, establish best practices and maintain high quality service for our recruiters, hiring managers and candidates. I provide mentorship and constructive feedback during my weekly 1:1's with each RC. I act as a sounding board for the RC team to talk openly to share struggles and successes. I lead a weekly RC meeting where we bring up issues of the week and work as a team to resolve them. These 1:1 and team meetings are valuable to me in continuing to see strengths in the team and being able to delegate projects and achieve team goals. 

A project that I have worked on this cycle that was impactful Argo wide was the job description overhaul. I worked closely with my manager to identify impactful changes and then worked with key partners to execute the project. Key partners included the RC's, recruiters and hiring managers. We now have a formal template for SW, HW, Vehicle Ops, G&A as well as contractor and part time templates. The new job descriptions provide relevant information to the candidate about what they would be doing and what experience is required for the role. They also clearly show what we need from hiring managers to attract top talent, while meeting the requirements of the immigration and legal team. 

Another project that I have worked on this cycle that was impactful was the candidate travel policy. We were seeing an issue where candidates were overspending during their travel for interviews. I benchmarked other companies in the industry on their reimbursement policies, submitted my recommendations to the appropriate team members and executed a new policy. This policy will save Argo money and leave less room for interpretation on the candidate side. In addition to this new policy, I standardized the way candidates submit for reimbursement. Candidates now have a Google form where they fill in relevant information related to their interview and attach receipts to the form, saving time and improving process internally. This project shows my ability to identify a problem, work cross functionally and execute a solution. 

I also continued to work on the 2018 Summer Internship Program. I worked with hiring managers to get job descriptions, set up Argo's Handshake account, collected resumes and coordinated interviews. I started to build relationships with the Career Services departments at various schools and promoted the Argo internships. Most recently, I helped onboard Ada DeFanti. Along with Randy, I am a go-to person for Ada. I provided Greenhouse training, shared university contacts am assisting with campus recruitment strategies for 2019.

Jess is the key leader for projects that develop in the coordination team.  She's created an travel/expense guide for candidates due to their inconsistent spending which will ultimately save Argo money.  She has been the main contact for Direct Travel to sort out any issues with candidate travel.  Jess has taken on owning the many templates that we use in greenhouse for both internal Argo clients and our external candidates 
Org impact:
Jess has worked on a number of projects that have/will impact teams across Argo's org.  One project that touched all teams within the org was to create specific job description for each headcount that we have in 2018. This helped our recruiting process on the back end as it tracked candidates to specific roles in greenhouse and it helps our efforts by having a thorough job description posted externally to peak applicants/candidates interests.  Another project that Jess has been helping the RC to drive is the Recruiting Process Training.  This training helps to set the expectations of an interviewer at Argo and is a very important to execute efficiently.  She helped make improvements to the deck and mentored Elena through the changes in the presentation.  One of the biggest impacts that Jess had over the past quarter was defining and implementing the hiring for the Intern Program.  We went from anticipating ~5 interns to hiring a class of 25 for the summer of 2018.  Jess used her prior experience in campus recruiting and drove the interview process for hundreds of candidates.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"During this cycle Jessica worked to create a travel reimbursement policy, she worked with Visit Pittsburgh on ideas for incoming candidates, she transitioned the internship program (which she built) over to Ada DeFanti, and she lead the efforts to make job descriptions uniform and put into templates.

Jessica has been a great lead.  She is extremely organized, very detail oriented, very calm, very positive, and she has earned the trust of our team.  She has Argo's best interests at heart and it shows in her efforts to make what we do look professional, as it did with the job descriptions, with email templates, and with the travel policy.

Jess treats all of us with respect, corrects without criticising, stays on top of everything we do, and keeps our team on an even keel.  ",,,Jeri McFadden,jmcfadden@argo.ai,Jessica Motz,jmotz@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Jess’s contributions to the RC team this cycle have been numerous and significant. Her most notable accomplishment has been her job description project. She did research on the job descriptions of competitors and designed a new template for each team’s job descriptions (G&A, Software, Hardware, etc). She did an incredible job of partitioning the work amongst her other team members and diligently tracked the progress of this project. She spent countless hours checking and double-checking the job formats, naming conventions, and content to ensure that we put our best foot forward when potential candidates are viewing our openings. In addition to this massive project, Jess headed the intern recruitment effort with Randy for the majority of the cycle. She was the point of contact for candidates, sending out assessments, scheduling calls and in person interviews, and keeping an open line of communication with hiring managers. Through her work on the internship project, Jess communicated with nearly every hiring manager and did an incredible job of balancing their needs, while being mindful of spatial limitations in our office. She acted as a welcome buddy for Ada and spent a lot of time helping her to ramp up, ensuring a smooth transfer of responsibilities. Another project that Jess has worked on this cycle has been improving our reimbursement policy. As our company matures, it is important that our policies mature as well and Jess has done a great job of being proactive about our candidate reimbursement policy. Over the past few weeks, she has been working with our finance team to devise a plan to make our reimbursement policy standard across all candidates and to firm up the guidelines of our policy. Another policy that Jess created this cycle was the depot visitation policy. Working with her recruiting teammates and team members from Vehicle Ops, Jess wrote and implemented a policy for candidate visits to the depot, specifying the responsibility of each team so that these visits are smooth for the candidates and not overly disruptive to any team members. Over the past cycle, Jess has really excelled in the following areas: collaboration, leadership, organization, and drive. She has been a driving force on the RC team, keeping the standards high and always striving for the best candidate experience. When the team has been given large projects to work on, Jess has done a great job of breaking those projects up and assigning tasks to team members based on their talents. She is always thinking of new ways to improve our process and is a sounding board for any problems that arise. ",,,Elena Paul,epaul@argo.ai,Jessica Motz,jmotz@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Jessica has shown some dynamic range this year.  She has taken on leading a team of RC's, helped to set up and establish an intern class with interview process and of course the best thing this year was the complete revamping of the job descriptions (which is critical to recruiting success). Oh wait, she still was the primary RC for 2 recruiters as well and handled all of these responsibilities with determination, tenacity and professionalism.  

She has grown in every aspect that you could look for in a leader and mentor.  She has gained the respect of those around her, she has made great strides to let her presences and overall impact to the team from her actions and leadership, and most of all she has clearly made a name for herself amongst the clients that we support.  It is with people like Jess that I know and believe that we cannot fail, that we can accomplish whatever tasks are set before us, know matter how difficult and most of all it is does with professionalism and top notch service/experience that we need to help us succeed.  She truly is amazing.

I have worked with Jessica since the day 1, she has supported me and Sarah both, handled managers from both the software and hardware side, met and exceeded expectations from those demands placed or her and done it all without question or complaining.  She is a great leader, exemplifies great customer and candidate experience and will not back down from challenges. When you look at the tasks at hand...from creating all new job descriptions across multiple teams and needs, to setting an internship process/program from virtually scratch to managing people across multiple locations and still being an RC....WOW is the only word that comes to mind.  

I could not be happier to be working with her and she provided amazing guidance and support during our time on the internship program before Ada started.  She has since still been apart of finding out about programs for co-ops and establishing guidelines for the program in the next years.  Great work, great attitude and most of all, she is just an amazing colleague to be working with and I could not be happier to have the opportunity to do so on a daily basis.  Please keep it up Jess!!!",,,Randy Visser,rvisser@argo.ai,Jessica Motz,jmotz@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"What are some specific accomplishments, projects, and results that this person drove during the review cycle timeframe?

Jess was assigned as an informal lead to the RC's at the beginning of the year. She has lead our RC sync and has had 1:1's with me since her appointment. Jess communicates directly with Jenn Gustin to work on RC specific projects. The projects she works on have a company wide impact and involve many people within the organization. 

What are areas where this person has grown and made improvements?
Jess has grown into the role of an informal Lead without being given much direction. She has gained the trust of the RC's through 1:1 communication and our weekly group meetings have taken shape where we chat about our week, any obstacles and collaborate on how to get better results. Jess gives everyone a chance to speak up and encourages everyone in our group to own their successes and failures. She has eliminated (in my own opinion) competition from the group and has created a more collaborative environment within the group.

In her role as informal Lead, Jess has been a great source of information, support and criticism. 

In the past few months she has opened herself up to feedback from the group and made constructive changes in the way she directs the group for projects and in how she addresses the group when giving feedback.

I have a stronger sense of what is expected of me to succeed and improve since she has become the Lead.

I feel a greater sense of acceptance within my group. I am more likely to share successes and less apprehensive of sharing concerns.

Our 1:1 meetings are productive and I look forward to them. She makes herself available whenever needed and I appreciate her sincerity whether it is in my favor or not. ",,,Lorena Villegas,lvillegas@argo.ai,Jessica Motz,jmotz@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"These feedback sections are in order of occurrence, not importance:

**Manages the Recruiting Coordinator (RC) Team**

Back when I transitioned to temporary People Ops lead, Jess took over managing the RC team as lead. She continues to do so and is excellent at managing the various dynamics and challenges on the RC team. Examples of this include keeping up with continuous changes to our hiring practices, improvements to our interviewing processes, and overall cleanup of Greenhouse as time goes on. I am impressed with her ability to do all of this while still maintaining her own duties as an RC, fully supporting Sarah and Randy. I have seen first hand her capacity to delegate. Jess is very aware of the strengths and weaknesses on the team, which is needed to delegate tasks effectively so that the team can complete a project. She is great at voicing concerns to Jenn, Randy or I when necessary but overall she deals with most things on the team or in her work by herself. 

**Job Description Cleanup Project**

Over the past few months, Jess took on a huge project where she developed new job description templates for full-time, part-time, contractor, and intern positions. She collaborated with Legal and People Ops to ensure compliance and industry best practices were being followed. After doing so, she worked with the RC team to individually update each job posting (50+) so they were in alignment with the new template. In addition to that, she consulted with me so that she and the RC team could update all job posting titles to be accurate, descriptive and following the Argo's format (based on Staff Compensation, Levels, and Titles file). Part of this project was working with the entire Recruiting team to collect team blurbs from each Hiring Manager. These team blurbs that were added to every job posting as well, a daunting task considering how busy Hiring Managers can be. She shared these new job descriptions templates with Hiring Managers to ensure they are used in the future. Now, we have a process in place where all job postings are reviewed before they are posted live to ensure things remain integrable moving forward. Jess is the initial reviewer of all job postings, not letting things through until they satisfy the Argo standard. Because of this project, we now make Hiring Managers think through the purpose of a role before bringing someone on, which helps interviewing teams have a better understanding of the role they are interviewing a candidate for.

**Summer Internship Program**

From the beginning, Jess voiced her interest in being involved with the Argo internship program, which was fully supported because of her background in internship programs at other companies. She stepped up to the plate and worked directly with Randy to develop and execute Argo's first summer internship program. Again, very impressed with her ability to add another project to her workload. Even with our internship program kicking off long after most students interviewed for internships (in the fall), Randy and her were able to quickly build out a program and interview process attractive enough to find 23+ summer interns! I was impressed by this, especially considering we had limited space for interns and a ton of interest from students. Currently, Jess is collaborating with Ada and Randy from a consultive perspective to build out strategic pieces of the internship program so that students have a full-blown experience while here at Argo in the summer, but also thinking about additional opportunities in the fall or spring.",,,Kyle Neff,kneff@argo.ai,Jessica Motz,jmotz@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"An area where I can improve is to set strict deadlines and clear expectations. If deadlines are missed, I need to have the confidence to send professional but firm emails showing the impact of the delay. An example of where I could have done this was with the job description project. I did not set strict enough deadlines and was not firm enough in my follow up and as a result, the project took too long to be completed. 

Another area of improvement would be finding the balance of holding the team to high standards, but still allowing them to work at their own speed and in their own style. I will work to determine what motivates team members and play to those strengths to accomplish goals and team OKR's. 

I can improve in the area of time management and prioritization. As a team lead, I have 1:1's with my team as well as my manager and other internal partners in addition to team meetings. I need to be able to handle daily meetings while still keeping up with my scheduling tasks. I will improve by organizing my calendar better and block off work time to handle my scheduling tasks. 

I can improve on cross functional team connectivity. As a manager I plan to be more involved with what the recruiting team needs from the RC's. I plan to meet regularly with the recruiters individually to understand their needs, what is going well and what needs improvement. This will improve overall team communication and in turn a better candidate experience. 
",,,Jessica Motz,jmotz@argo.ai,Jessica Motz,jmotz@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,manager,"Jess has taken on responsibilities for the manager role and we've discussed areas where she is excelling and where she needs to focus her efforts on.  One focus that has been identified is setting deadlines/urgency for large projects.  In completing the job description revamp, it became clear that the recruiters were going to need some extra encouragement to get their parts done, which added a longer timeline to the projects completion.  Going forward, Jess can bake in time for these larger projects and/or work directly with the key contributors to get a request completed.
Jess has had some chances to identify weaknesses on the team and we have been working together to mentor/manage these issues so that the RC team can function at the highest standards.  Jess will have some room to grow in this area once she steps into a manager role and has authority to call more of the shots.",,,Jenn Gustin,jenn@argo.ai,Jessica Motz,jmotz@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"One of the areas where Jessica can grow and improve is team transparency.  Knowing what the other team members are working on, and sharing that information, will allow each member to contribute if desired and will foster greater creativity and closer working relationships within the team.  

The job descriptions were a big undertaking and were deadlined.  But there were no consequences to encourage the deadline.  For example, we could have been instructed to unpublish jobs until missing parts were completed.  This would have encouraged hiring managers to finish the descriptions and it would mean that everything open to the public would look uniform.  

One of the biggest challenges facing anyone in a leadership role is understanding the different working styles of each team member, figuring out what motivates each team member, and then how best to incorporate that knowledge to create a solid team.  This is an area where Jess can grow and improve; something to keep in mind as she grows into and beyond her current role.


 

",,,Jeri McFadden,jmcfadden@argo.ai,Jessica Motz,jmotz@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Jess has been an incredible team lead and, with her guidance, our team has been able to accomplish some exciting things this past cycle. If I had to cite an area of improvement, I would say that, at times, Jess could have been more stern with team members. Jess was put in a tricky position of transitioning from teammate to team lead and she handled that transition with grace. Jess has an incredible way of being forward when providing feedback, but also doing so in a constructive, positive way. I know that Jess has worked to maintain a collaborative, team environment and when she has assigned priority projects, she’s done so assuming that these projects would be completed in a timely manner. The only problem has been that our team members have different definitions of timely, so in these instances, Jess may need to clearly state a deadline in the future. If the project is not completed by that deadline or is not completed correctly, there may need to be consequences. Another suggestion for improvement would be for Jess to hold people accountable for their work. She should not be responsible for fixing the mistakes of others if they have done a careless job and should not have to dedicate her evenings to completing or redoing tasks. ",,,Elena Paul,epaul@argo.ai,Jessica Motz,jmotz@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Trying to pinpoint areas that Jess needs improvement on can be difficult as she has taken on and been responsible for so much.  I know that as we have pulled things away from her by hiring Ada, it has freed up some of her time, but being able to juggle all of these tasks is difficult and learning to balance her time will be critical to her success.  I also think that she can hold those around her to a higher standard, just like she has held herself to such a standard and make them more accountable.  I know that this comes from time and experience, which she is gaining, but I look forward to seeing how she continues to grow and develop as a peer, mentor and manager of people.  

Jess also recognizes the areas that she needs to work on, so I want her to make sure that she recognizes that we will continue to need her with our intern focus next year, that her years of experience in this particular space are invaluable to both myself and Ada.  She will continue to work on her communication skills, both listening to and conveying her own message back (break out of that shell like I have seen you do).  I also want Jess to speak up more, give ideas and of course don't be afraid to disagree with the rest of us (we are not always right and I know that I am not right most of the time).  You have a great deal of knowledge and experience that others can learn from, so please share it.   I also would like to continue to see Jess push back, push back on Managers, recruiters and whomever else is not complying with what she is asking for.  I know that she was getting lots of push back from others when updating all these news job descriptions, but she pushed back on managers and recruiters to get the information to her, so please continue to do that and don't be afraid to put deadlines on items like this in the future.  
",,,Randy Visser,rvisser@argo.ai,Jessica Motz,jmotz@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"What are some areas where this person can grow and improve?

There are few and minor instances where the communication on projects have crossed. I ask that Jess give written direction and be receptive to follow up questions. At times, I will receive a message and with feedback that I gave her, I did receive written instruction. I followed up with questions and the answers to my questions felt more like I shouldn't be asking them. We all have different communication styles and levels of comfort with visible projects. 

Jess is great at being direct with communicating what she is thinking, and carries herself with a genuine attitude. In times that we are all under pressure, I think a little more focus on her outward communication is an area of growth. Essentially we are working under her direction to reach a deadline and if the communication at a certain point is cut off, short or tense, we all begin to feel it as well.  

What are some projects where this person could have done better?

As Jess has worked with us on several stages of a project, I have seen her improve how she gives out direction. I think she is going to continue to grow in this area and other projects are started. 

Think about not only results, but also about how this person collaborates and works with others.

Unfortunately, other than the RC's I do not have much insight to how Jess works with others outside of our group. As for the RC's, Jess knows the highs and lows of RC work and is always ready to improve our process to make us successful. She has done a great job and I appreciate her long distance collaboration with me and bringing me closer to my own team. ",,,Lorena Villegas,lvillegas@argo.ai,Jessica Motz,jmotz@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"**Roadblocks**

I think an area where Jess can improve is navigating roadblocks. If things are stalled, she should be sure to communicate at a high level the issue to all parties involved. In doing so, she will be able to get assistance where needed without spinning her wheels. It also will alleviate pressure on herself if all parties are aware of details or situations that would otherwise go unseen. The idea is to be assertive, in a smart way, so she does not get slowed down or stalled by things out of her immediate control. 

From my vantage point, I have definitely seen her speak up and voice her opinion or concern more often in 2018 (in comparison to previous quarters), which has been great. I just think she needs to feel like she is in a place where she is truly managing the RCs beyond the lead role so that she feels empowered to take action and truly own it.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"During my time since starting at Argo, not only did I get up-to-speed with the Infrastructure team and begin with development there, I was also able to successfully transfer to the prediction team, on which I made valuable contributions to the development and testing of our core four-way intersection logic, which was required not only for the demo at the end of March, but also for the Miami Experience later this year.  I also have been actively working to develop and improve visualization tools used by the prediction team.

In addition, I have also been working to incrementally the quality and maintainability of the prediction code base both in the code I have written and elsewhere in the prediction code base, to optimize our code as we progress towards a thread-safe implementation.  I have also been working to refactor the interface to the prediction code that is used both internally and externally to provide both a cleaner interface and to help more completely test our code base.  Many of these tasks were important for meeting the goals of the prediction team for both the March demo, and looking forwards for the Miami Experience.

While working with other members of the prediction team, I have also been helping to bring team members up-to-speed with the prediction code base, some features of the C++ programming language our code base is written in, and the development tools and practices used at Argo.  This has helped to make sure our team is on the same page with the development process and the structure of the prediction code.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"John has, in many ways, been the glue that has enabled the new prediction team to be successful.  He has been the driving force in reorganizing and separating from motion planning.  He knows the organization of the prediction code better than anyone and has been central to every PR I have landed.

He has restructured the entire Prediction codebase, moving us out of Motion Planning, separating the interface and the engine, and organizing functions into helpers where they can be easily tested.  He implemented much of the logic for handling protected intersections.  He is currently building the viz tools we need to quickly debug and diagnose issues from logs.

In addition to doing his own work, cleaning our backlog, and performing thorough and efficient code reviews, John is always happy and willing to educate and help Slawek and I.  My first working on the AV codebase, I literally sat at John's desk.  He was patient and pedagogical, explaining not only what certain best practices where, but why.  He is also exceedingly polite and nice to work with.  He willingly gives his time but is also quick to thank anyone for a minute of theirs.  I have really enjoyed getting to know and working with John.

I have also been really impressed with John's growth and flexibility.  He is a quiet person by nature and also likes to see things done right (particularly w.r.t. structure and organization).  The reality of working on a new team at Argo, is that code must go through many intermediate states before getting to the done stage and that you have to find and ask people for help.  AVs are complicated.  John has shown tremendous flexibility in restructuring prediction over many steps, ensuring that each iteration works as expected.  After restructuring any code he is also responsive and helpful with any rebasing issues or general questions.  John has also grown a lot, in my time here, in terms of reaching out, asking questions and speaking up.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"I've successfully established weekly planning rhythms for 4 different Teams managing the Sprint Tracker and jira boards to improve data flow between Management and Tech Leads.

I pulled together with other TPM's the Z1 Bring up plan to help The upper management team understand the resources required and risks associated with planning for Z1 vehicles to be used in Miami.  In doing so I've worked to better interface the HW and Software teams to mitigate risk and eliminate surprises.  I coordinated required dev kits and their locations along with resource allocation to ensure team members knew ahead of time what would be available to develop on.  This significantly reduced the risk to camera bring up by enabling Harpreet to test a camera-GPU DMA task within 2 weeks of the start of Q2.  This was one of the riskiest tasks for PI in the quarter.

I worked with my tech leads to develop Q2 plans to help the SW teams  determine dependencies and plan for longer term tasks. This caught key dependencies between PI and ML and STS and SIM.  In addition, I've tried to provide team members with information on longer term milestones and goals to help prevent surprise deadlines for team members.

I worked with the HW team to mount the A-sample 128 lidar on a vehicle.  I successfully evaluated the teams ability to execute and planned a reasonable timeline.  The good communication between teams made the project quick efficient and even more successful than expected, significantly buying down Z1 risk.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"John is a strong technical program manager with a breadth of experience and skills that enable him to positively impact projects. He works well with others, offers great/honest feedback, and advocates for the best outcome for the program.  Whether John is leading, co-leading, or supporting, I've found John to be a great asset to the projects/programs on which we've interacted. 

Due to his flexibility, John is filling a different, with more impact, role than that which he was originally hired to serve. In addition to providing Technical Program Management for the Systems team, John also assists the leaders of the STS, Archictecture, PI, Special Projects, and (recently) Calibration teams. He began at Argo with some knowledge in these areas, but he has grown and improved both his technical and communications acumen to support these areas.

The area I've seen John have the biggest impact is in his efforts to help organize the Z1 Build and Bring-Up. The coordination between SW & HW has much room for improvement, but John has driven through risks to help TLs and ICs deliver improved plans, clarity on risks, and even a few deliverables ahead of schedule (e.g., the FPGA-to-GPU DMA efforts). 

John brings a strong, grounded view to the SW-TPM team by seeing through some of the transient aspects, by maintaining focus on the core, important elements without being too distracted by inefficient or ineffective processes. John has great ideas, but he's also respectful of others' ideas. I'm glad John is on the team.",,,Ryan Morton,rmorton@argo.ai,John Seminatore,jseminatore@argo.ai,Software,

First, he tries to understand the nature of the problem we are trying to solve to be able to get a smarter discussion around planning.

His idea about making some general architecture document to clarify the subject for himself and the team is excellent and shows great communication skills.

He always applies the right amount of pressure to get stuff done with compassion and understanding without being annoying. This makes us more efficient and really part of the same ""one argo boat"".

I would like to also underline the quiet leadership qualities of Semi: he'll always give sound advice  when we face tense situations. I also really appreciate his coaching on  those occasions.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"John has made a strong contribution in his short time at Argo and his leadership abilities shine through regularly. I would challenge John to let the leader come out more often. He gets tasks done, follows up, and ensures other meet their deliverables; these are not issues for him. Often he takes charge and ensures everyone knows their marching orders. However, occasionally, the tasking, the next steps, or even who's the point-of-contact is not clear to participants (and requires further clarification). This happened with Z1 bring-up, which was alleviated with additional discussions, but once John-the-leaders came out, (once he proposed an improved structure) the SW efforts got back on track. John, his teams, and Argo overall would benefit if this variant of John came out more often. Simply recap with ""In summary, Bill's doing X, Nancy's will complete Y, and Pat will deliver Z.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Accomplishments:
I largely drove the entirety of the implementation and integration of the map build pipeline from non existent at the start to what it is today. This required a wide breadth of work from bare infrastructure work on AWS, deploying and maintaining Airflow in a production capacity, authoring Airflow workflows, integrating the code that SAIPS produced, and creating various tooling to facilitate handoffs to the rest of the team.

I did almost all of the operational work in producing the first several maps that we've built, including the rote execution of the builds, triaging untold number of issues in Airflow and with the code under operation, reporting issues to SAIPS and internally, and iterating on various improvements to make operational life easier. This involved a lot of hand holding in the initial months and ensured my blood sweat and tears went into a number of our early maps.

Collaboration:
I worked significantly with SAIPS to integrate their code in Airflow and to help them test various changes and fixes in the real pipeline, along with helping them setup and manage a separate cluster for their own testing. I worked with Bob a lot to triage various log extraction issues. I sent most of my code through Matt for Python insight. Most recently I've been working a lot with Weiwei Kunal and Ying to facilitate transitioning operational work and knowledge to be better scalable across the MAPREP team.

Areas of Growth:
Almost every area that I work on now has been a growth point as I have had very little experience in any of it prior to joining Argo. AWS in general, tooling to manage AWS infrastructure (Terraform, Packer), Airflow were totally new to me and what I work in depth with currently. In addition, I had written very little Python before, and certainly not production grade, and now I almost exclusively write Python, where my ability has improved dramatically. I would say I'm quite happy with my growth technically so far.

Strengths:
I would say my core strength has been the ability to take ownership anywhere in our stack to keep the map build production rolling as well as possible, with comfort in operational and development concerns (with the stress that I am a software not a devops engineer). I also strive to ensure that I help people get the information they need from me quickly and that I keep us on track production-wise as best as possible.",,,John Smodic,jsmodic@argo.ai,John Smodic,jsmodic@argo.ai,Software,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"John is the go-to person for map automation and anything Airflow-related. During the time I worked with him closely, he drove the ASG auto-scaler feature to completion, which alleviated engineers from having to scale up/down AWS node every time. He also authored almost all integration code, made sure maps are moving through the production pipeline, and fix any issues that arises. This made sure we don't block map production, which is critical to the organization's success. 

As I get involved in operations and started taking production workload from John, we collaborated closely and are in frequent communications. Being an effective communicator, the knowledge transfer happened effectively. John is also quick to answer any questions, on and off business hours, that made the transition much more easier. John also collaborated with SAIPS in surfacing issues and getting them fixed.

I also witnessed the improvement in John's Python skills, as I started reviewing integration code. John picked up suggestions from reviewers and used them to improve code day in and day out. ",,,WeiWei Kang,wkang@argo.ai,John Smodic,jsmodic@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"John owns Airflow and virtually all things AWS that relate to map-production (at least, that's how it seems to me).  He's always helpful when I need to track down a log or understand something about how the SAIPS jobs are being run.  He's also helpful in general for weird ""Hey John, I don't know how AWS works"" stuff.

I agree with John's assessment that he's done a great job helping to keep the map-production pipeline rolling in spite of a whole bunch of bumps along the road thus far.  We've produced a lot of maps and virtually all of them are a direct result of John's efforts in one way or another.",,,Matt Gilson,mgilson@argo.ai,John Smodic,jsmodic@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"John could make an effort to document knowledge that is helpful for others involved in operations. In the long term this reduces the load on him to answer questions, promotes knowledge sharing in the team, and would allow others to contribute to the documentation.

Another area of improvement, which John mentioned himself, is better documentation of production steps in JIRA tickets. This right now is an important way of troubleshooting a produced map. I do understand that paper trail is not easy to maintain under tight deadline, especially in the early days when we didn't have effective tooling.

I also think that John could do a better job of helping shape some of our standard usages of Docker and Java etc.  I think that he has more skills in these areas than some members of the team (or at least he has experience that could be leveraged more than we are now).

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Since the Fall review I feel I've grown as a valuable contributor to the company's success, though I must admit that singing my own praises isn't something I'm particularly good at or comfortable with.  One of the major and most obvious examples of this value lies in the fact that we've been shorthanded for quite some time.  We've had some key departures, which have resulted in a drastically increased workload for myself and Dom.  I would say we've not only handled this situation, but actually excelled in the face of obvious adversity.

In my opinion keeping our heads above water given the circumstances would be impressive enough, but I feel we've gone beyond that and have actually improved several aspects of the service we provide.  The demands on our department have only grown more frequent and complex.  I understand that this is my own personal review, but it's impossible and disingenuous to sit here trying to boast about my value and accomplishments without pointing out that Dom has been a critical help to me, and without his contributions and the hard work he's put in I really wouldn't be able to do what I do.

I've tried to take a tough situation and turn it into as much of a positive as possible.  One example of this would be continuing to try to push our  technology forward.  In the past I've questioned certain aspects of what we do, such as the drives we buy and was told that these were decisions others had made so we were going to stick with them.  After talking with several people in different roles it was clear to me that what we were providing wasn't quite suited to the growing needs of others, so I've started purchasing newer model drives, and carrying a larger capacity drive for users who told me they use a ton of docker images and and store lots of log files.  I've also heard from several users that i/o is absolutely critical to their work, so I've begun purchasing and testing drives that are three to four times faster than what we've been using to this point.  To be clear, I've discussed and cleared these moves with those above me, I didn't just decide to go rogue and do whatever I want.

A recent example of Dom and I collaborating to ensure we were ahead of the curve started with Dom noticing we had a very large group of people in various positions starting on the same day in late May.  After he pointed this out, he and I worked together for over a month to ensure we had all the hardware we needed for these new people, while still keeping up with our needs for the workers who have started in the meantime.  A little foresight and effort on our part resulted in us being fully prepared for this group of people well before their start date.  We also often have to address needs thrown at us with little warning.  When it was decided that some of the VOs would pitch in to help with labelling work, we were given about a day and a half to prep seven or eight 5520s for this purpose.  We had to sacrifice a couple test computers, but we got everything built and ready for Tyler and Patrick on time while Josh Stonemark threw together the networking setup required at the depot, and we've continued to keep up with them as users are cycled in and out.

Another example I'd like point out is that even when we were at full strength I became the go-to person for the frequent, annoying issues inherent with trying to make nvidia cards work in Linux systems.  I volunteered to work on this just for the challenge of it, and while we still occasionally have some minor issues I was able to beat back the frequent, work-halting issues that started popping up on developer systems around February and limit the nvidia-related issues we have to a couple specific problems that can be fixed in a matter of minutes by running one of a couple scripts I wrote.

I've also examined some of our daily tasks and tried to make these smarter and simpler wherever possible.  I've taken our standard computer builds from four pages of instructions on what to install and how to install it to running two or three scripts, drastically simplifying and shortening the build process for our group, and saving as us all very valuable time.  I scripted out things like installing/enabling SSH, installing CrowdStrike, and the nvidia driver and cuda installations.

Much of the work I do is driven by the communication I have with people across different roles and different locations.  I was brought into the discussion of the requirements for the Z1 fleet laptop, which resulted in me having the responsibility of coming up with options for, ordering, and working with different teams to test different models.  Our first Z1 test laptop is currently being built and shipped to us.  This project also seemed to stop getting any attention from others involved, so Matt Puchalski and I picked it back up and pushed it forward again.  I've been asked for help working with the testing  and troubleshooting the HaloCreeks and Percy, I've helped troubleshoot vehicle connectivity issues, and am the go-to person for issues with our VO laptops.  At this point any time an issue comes up with developers, engineers, or ops people that involves the VO 5520s I'm brought into the conversation to assist.  Joho just brought me in on his issue with updating network settings.  Dave Schwanky came to me recently for a solution to ensure the operators couldn't have the VO laptops on the internet while connected to the vehicle.  Mat Priest contacts me mainly for login loop issues that arise because of the nvidia drivers.  Kevin Swanson asked me to come up with a method for upgrading the driver version on the VO laptops.  Rob Vaniglia brought me in on the  conversation regarding coming up with a solution for keeping the 5520s from overheating when in use.  I'm also involved in the planning for switching these over to Salt as a deployment mechanism to replace the Swanserver laptop.

An example of helping out based on just random conversations with people is work I completed for Ben Ballard.  Prior to ordering larger, faster drives he had let me know that he felt the SSD in his 7710 had been wonky for a while and that he was also in need of more than a terabyte of space due to his need to keep large amounts of log files locally, and that speed was important to him.  We didn't really have any existing solution that would help him, so I customized a setup for him by installing two 512GB NVMe drives for him (we have piles of these since we swap them for Crucial drives in pretty much everything), installing Linux on one of those at his request, and then also adding a 1TB 2.5"" Crucial SSD for his log storage needs, all encrypted with LUKS, which was not a trivial task.  The extra effort put into this resulted in a happy user who seemed very grateful that he was able to just tell us what problems he was having and have a solution provided for him.  

With Becky's departure I've picked up new responsibilities not because I was asked or forced to, but because I saw a need and decided to take the lead.  I took over our weekly group meeting to ensure we maintained a forum to discuss issues we're seeing or questions we have and I've taken point on getting answers for the group when issues arise or some uncertainty needs to be addressed.  I've also assisted Dom in the ordering of hardware and planning for our coming needs, as in the example mentioned above.  I've reached out to some of our vendors, as well, which has been productive.  Apple is offering services they previously hadn't offered to us after I reached out to them.  Matt Puchalski and I have discussed the Z1 laptop needs with Dell, and Dell also provided information on their soon-to-be released new models.  We'll be testing those as soon as possible.  I've taken over maintenance of the encryption server and am working on getting us upgraded to a new version to address issues we've seen with SecureDoc, which has slowed progress on completing the encryption project.  I also volunteered to take ownership of the OS setup and imaging procedures, which involves maintaining and adjusting the FOG server and the Ubuntu preseed configuration.  I've also been involved in the interview process for finding a new team member.

Fairly frequently I've been sent to the other offices to handle different situations.  I basically was left to handle the initial encryption push on my own in Dearborn.  I was chosen to travel to Mountain View to help RJ get acclimated to the job when he was hired, and did the same for Born in Dearborn.  I traveled to Dearborn with Becky to knock out the CrowdStrike install quickly.  I was also sent to Mountain View in March when it was felt some assistance was needed in getting certain aspects of our work back on track.

To summarize, I probably do a poor job of really stating my value and all I do, but basically my goal is to make life as simple as possible for my all of my coworkers - team members, managers, and everyone else across the company.  I try to leverage my experience as well as my willingness and ability to learn new things to be as useful to others as possible, while also being friendly and approachable.  I try to lead by example and take on any challenge that presents itself, but I fully recognize the fact that I in no way am alone in this and much of what I do wouldn't be possible without the support of the rest of our team.",,,Josh Davis,jdavis@argo.ai,Josh Davis,jdavis@argo.ai,General & Administrative,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Josh has become an integral part of the IT team and has been monumental in propelling the team forward to further success. I've had the pleasure of starting at Argo on the same day as him and working alongside him on the Help Desk team and I can firmly say that any success the IT group has achieved is likely due in large part to the hard work he has put in. As Josh mentioned in his self-review and as many are aware there has been some turnover in the IT department with the departure of two Help Desk support specialists and the transition of Kelly Mullins to her new role with the Facilities team. While these circumstances are not ideal, they are the circumstances in which we find ourselves and circumstances that I feel have helped Josh excel and further illustrate his value and commitment to the team and company. 

In looking back in the time that has quickly gone by since the Fall review cycle, there has been a lot that I feel Josh has played a key role in. One example of this would be his technical troubleshooting of various Nvidia issues that began popping up and plaguing different developer laptops. Josh was able to determine through troubleshooting the incompatibility of the Nvidia drivers in use with ubuntu kernel versions being deployed. To remedy this, Josh worked on writing up a script that we could use to quickly remedy this; this script would purge the Nvidia drivers, reinstall them and made sure they were put on a hold to prevent them from being updated and causing display failures. 

As time moved on, our four person Help Desk team shrunk to a 3 person team as one of our members seemed to disengage entirely in the various projects we set out to achieve. While this became apparent to most everyone on the IT team, Josh did not complain and instead worked harder by staying late to ensure the work was completed. This involved creating and working through a process to retroactively encrypt laptops that are already deployed, without using the standard WinMagic Secure Doc software. In that same time, Josh discovered an issue in which the Forensic software we were set to use on returned machines from off-boarded employees did not work with the Mac OS versions we have deployed. He quickly did some research and reached out to a company (Recon) for an alternative. He then single-handedly worked through some steps to get this working and begin cloning hard drives in a stack of computer we needed to run Forensics on. 

It was also during this time that he has worked closely with members of the Ops team to combat some issues that popped up with different vehicle laptops. When it became apparent during ""Code Red"" that the vehicle laptops may be underperforming due to the amount of RAM installed in the machines, Josh quickly took the lead by ordering additional RAM that could be used, once ordered he and I worked together on upgrading all RAM in all the vehicle laptops. 

Josh has also volunteered numerous times to take on the responsibility of traveling to the other offices to assist other teammates and ensure IT projects were completed, this includes multiple trips to MTV to assist RJ and a trip to Dearborn to train Born when he started. I think that is one of Josh's strongest traits: his willingness to always lend a hand where needed. He has been very important and helpful in explaining procedures and process to me that I may not understand right away. He has always been a teammate that when he comes in the morning his first question is ""What's going on? Is there anything you need help with?"" before getting into the work he has on his own plate. I can't thank him enough for that, it is really appreciated and goes a tremendously long way in making the work day more enjoyable and less stressful. 

Josh furthered this once Becky departed our team. I feel Josh stepped up in a big way to make sure some of the turnover on our team was noticed as little as possible. He strived to make sure the disruption did little to impede or impact our work and performance. He did this by making it a point to become involved in the inventory ordering, and making sure our inventory stock levels where were they needed to be not just for our Pittsburgh office, but for our other offices as well. Josh also made it a point to keep our weekly Help Desk meetings going without any sort of hiccup, as he realized the importance of staying in a regular communication with our other team members on the happenings within our group and the projects we needed to continue to follow through with--one of these being the project of encryption.

Recently, Josh and I began to notice different issues popping up with Secure Doc (Secure Doc not being able to be installed and function on machines set to UEFI and Secure Doc preventing Windows Updates from installing) as we both investigated these issues, we both reached the conclusion that our best method for moving forward and fixing these issues would be to upgrade our Secure Doc server. As Josh has an extensive amount of experience in IT and specifically with servers, he jumped right and began working on upgrading our server so we could continue on with our work and finish up encrypting the remaining machines. 

Josh has also begun reaching out to some of our vendors, Apple specifically, to see what sort of benefits they could/would offers us or get a better idea of some services that were being offered that we were missing out on. This was not asked of him, but rather something he realized would benefit out team tremendously in terms of production and efficiency. I feel that's always at the forefront of his mind--to make tasks more efficient and easier for his teammates. He further exemplifies this with his ownership of OS deployments. He quickly began managing our FOG deployment server, which was used extensively for a short while before we converted over to our current Ubuntu pre seed configuration, this has cut down time on imaging significantly, especially with the use of the numerous preseed post-installation scripts that Josh created. These make creating accounts, installing apps, and ensuring the correct Nvidia drivers are installed as easy as a snap of the finger. As I mentioned, this has cut down build times dramatically and has allowed us to be able to focus our attention more on other issues, this is extremely helpful now with the Pittsburgh team consisting of Josh and myself.

I feel I could go on at length for a few more paragraphs, but in the end I'll type the same conclusion. Josh is a key contributor to his success, my success, and the

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"While I've tried to make sure I document many of the things I do, I know there's always room for improvement in this area.  Since everyone seems to have switched over to the scripts I wrote for builds I made sure to create documents both on the server and on Drive that list the scripts that exist, what they do, and when they'd be used.  However, time is something we never have enough of, and I certainly admit that I'll often skip documentation in favor of trying to get other work done.  I do still try to work on this but I'm hoping when the team is at full strength again there will be more time for documentation.

The encryption project is an ongoing one and while I regularly still reach out to people to get them converted, this has been a bit slower than I'd like.

I'm typically willing to drop whatever I'm doing to help others with their problems, which sounds great, but inevitably something is going to end up getting delayed as a result.  While I feel I generally do a good job of multitasking and following through on issues, I do end up having to back-burner some tickets or issues.

This section is drastically shorter than the positive section, but I truly am highly critical of myself and generally feel that most everything I do could've been better in some way.  I essentially only view things based on what I didn't know enough about or could've done better or faster.  I try to counter that by being open to and enthusiastic about learning more and making use of the people and other resources available to me to help me improve.",,,Josh Davis,jdavis@argo.ai,Josh Davis,jdavis@argo.ai,General & Administrative,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"In the past six months at Argo, I have spent the lion's share of my time working on the Sensor Gateway Unit (SGU). My role has been to own all hardware aspects of the module, and interface with anyone who is working on related pieces, such as software, firmware, cameras, and other AVS modules. This started out as working to develop an architecture and specification for the system back in October and November, through schematic work in January and February, and finally into manufacturing interface and support in March and April.

My role in the specification of the SGU started as a series of proposals for hardware architectures to accommodate the extreme bandwidth requirements for the system. This involved calculating bandwidth for multiple interfaces (MIPI CSI-2, PCIe, GMSL2, FPD-Link III, etc.) and ensuring that there was sufficient bandwidth and margin to allow the system to transfer the incoming camera data to the GPUs. Once it was understood what the I/O requirements were, the team moved to selection of FPGAs, which I led along with Dane. We evaluated different size devices as well as devices from different manufacturers to understand what was available, and then reached out to them to gauge levels of support and availability. I proposed the use of a System on a Module (SoM) to speed up development, trading off unit cost for development time. This, along with a few other architectural decisions, culminated in me leading the ""SGU Critical Decisions"" meeting. This meeting is where we got sign-off from different teams on critical design decisions to unblock the development of the SGU. We made 6 out of 7 critical decisions in the meeting, with the 7th being the logging architecture which took a few more weeks of work to finish up. Then, I worked on selecting the SoM to be used in the SGU. By the end of November, all the details were in place to start the SGU schematic. These two months showed my growth in my ability to design a system architecture that met the requirements for the system, defend the choices I made in the design with evidence and data, and push for critical decisions to be made to unblock future development work. I shifted my focus from being an engineer who designs to a specification to an engineer who creates/collaborates on a specification based on the needs of the system.

Through December and January, I completed schematic entry for the SGU, taking in feedback from our partners at DornerWorks to ensure our design had contingency plans in case they could not fit the design into three SoMs. The schematic proved to be the largest design I have worked on to date, with 14 unique pages (with many being instantiated multiple times) and over 1000 components. I reached out to manufacturers and peers for reviews and feedback, and incorporated changes as necessary. There were multiple cases where major portions of the design had to be redone due to new information from DornerWorks, iVeia, or any of other other internal or external partners. This period forced me to improve my ability to manage relationships with suppliers and partners, as well as how I lean on our own internal resources. I had to find the experts in what I was trying to implement or, when necessary, become the expert myself. When layout work started in February after a few weeks of delay from PPI, I was responsible for ensuring that the layout engineer at DornerWorks was aware of what the critical portions of the design were, and providing guidance for how the layout should be executed. I also had to review his work and ensure a level of quality and best practices, knowing when to lean on him for his experiential knowledge and when to push back against the direction he was headed in.

The manufacturing handoff for the SGU was a somewhat painful process that has taken longer than anticipated. However, I have been staying on top of the inquiries from PPI and making sure they have all the information they need to complete the work. I also spent significant amounts of time interfacing with iVeia to ensure they will be able to deliver materials on time. My focus shifted to laying out the test plans and infrastructure needed to bring up the SGU in a timely manner in order to make up for lost time due to layout and manufacturing delays. Our timeframe for A sample bringup to B sample release was squeezed down to a few weeks, and so my focus was ensuring we wasted no time bringing up A samples. I developed two different GMSL test boards and the SGU-Breakout board. I also sought out platforms to use for testing PCI Express without needing a working SWM board in order to ensure that the progress of the SGU was not blocked on the functionality of the SWM. This was an area in which I improved greatly from start to finish, as previously I had little experience creating detailed bringup and test plans. Additionally, I took on a cross-functional role of owning the petalinux building and booting process for the SoMs on the SGU. Although this is not my area of expertise, I was able to make progress to the point where I could unblock engineers at Argo and DornerWorks. This was a good experience for learning how to take on tasks outside of my domain of expertise.

The six month development cycle of the SGU has not been entirely smooth, but we have learned a lot as a team and will carry these lessons into B samples to create a working system, and then on to Z2+ designs. I was able to use this development cycle as an opportunity to utilize my abilities to push the program forward as well as learn new skills along the way.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"In reflecting on the work I've done in the past six months, I can identify a few areas where I can grow and improve. First and foremost, I would like to improve my own project management skills. I often found myself juggling multiple tasks with different priorities, and didn't always prioritize correctly. Sometimes priorities weren't clear to me until later. For example, it took me a while to conduct the full review of the SWM board. I knew it was something that needed to be done, but I was waiting for information to land in my lap instead of seeking the task out and tackling it in a timely manner. One way I intend to address this is to improve my task tracking skills, doing a better job of writing things down and reviewing my task list regularly. I also need to ask myself and others what the relative priority levels are, leaning on our PMs or my manager when things are unclear.

I want to use the next few months to improve my ability to support other projects and branch out beyond just the SGU. My shortcomings in this area have been settling for ""being present"" on some projects, such as near field cameras for Z1/Z2+. I have been somewhat tunnel-visioned on the SGU, and will participate in other projects as necessary (such as vendor visits or calls for cameras), but I need to improve my ability to understand requirements and contribute to specifications for other systems beyond just the SGU. There isn't as much value in me sitting in vendor meetings when I don't have a grasp on the trade space for what we are evaluating. In order to provide the most positive impact within the organization, I need to look at where I can fill in gaps in other teams while still providing full focus to what I am being tasked with.

One more area of improvement is my vendor relationship handling. This was a place where I wanted to improve from last review cycle, and although I think I've gotten better, I know there is more room for improvement. Two major aspects that I think need to improve are communicating my expectations clearly, and being more critical of what I am told is feasible. For communication, I have noticed a few instances where I don't communicate far enough ahead of time, eating away at our vendors/partners time to address problems. On the other hand, I have also had issues overestimating the abilities of some of our partners. I had higher expectations of iVeia and their ability to deliver, and would have benefited from being skeptical of their early promises. In the future, I intend to do more due diligence on how realistic our partner's delivery dates are.",,,Joshua Franz,jfranz@argo.ai,Joshua Franz,jfranz@argo.ai,Hardware,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Throughout my time at Argo, I have worked on numerous projects spanning across a wide variety of teams. During my first week on the facilities team, I was tasked with redesigning our Argo employee, contractor, temp, intern, and Ford badges. My boss at the time, Amy DeFilippo, and I sat down to brainstorm different concepts to include in an initial round of design proofs/options. When designing something, I always like to present at least three different concepts to the intended user. This gives the “client” a variety of graphics to choose from and gets us closer to a cohesive final product. Using this preferred proofing system, I presented Amy with a Slides document containing four different concepts: Roadmaps, Street Signs, Cityscape, and Logo. These designs were created with software from the Adobe Creative Cloud, InDesign - all were consistent with Argo’s branding (teal and orange), each tied together with its own special theme. As you can see, this doc was created before I even knew Argo had it’s own Slides template style, serving as proof that I was willing to jump in and present my ideas even before receiving the company’s standard presentation format and tools. 

Amy presented this document to Matt Williams hoping for some feedback on what concepts he liked, didn’t like, and what he thought should be presented to upper management. After this meeting, we were told to put this project on hold and that changes weren’t ready to be made. Fast forward to Friday, March 9 - I was on a weekend trip to Florida when I received a text message from Amy letting me know that one of my designs for the new badges had been chosen, Cityscapes; as soon as I came back to work the following Tuesday, changes were to be made in order to roll out the new badges in a timely manner. I was up for the challenge and designed the badge that is now worn by every employee, contractor, temp, intern, and Ford visitor here at Argo. 

Shortly after the badge project was initially put on hold, Amy asked that I come up with signs to help promote the recycling and compost “green” initiative around the office. I researched different examples of how different types of waste affect our environment in order to get a better idea of what to include on the signage. By providing clear notation of what waste goes where, (in theory) there is virtually no excuse for trash to be improperly sorted. Amy and I decided that we would enforce this new plan by 1) creating two large, heavy-duty Gatorboard posters to be hung in each of the mini kitchens within our space 2) creating magnets to fit over the openings of our trash/recycle/compost bins, and 3) creating tags to hang with each product in the kitchen and coolers. The posters were designed to give a comprehensive overview of why this initiative is important for Argo and the environment. The magnets were designed specific to each type of bin, giving examples of what to do with each kind of waste. The tags were designed product specific - they explicitly state what to do with each wrapper, can, bag, etc. I created these items in both Adobe InDesign and Illustrator, and then presented these signs, tags, and magnets to Amy in a Slides doc for review. 

Once we reached a final design and verdict, I reached out to Alphagraphics for quotes on both the Gatorboard signs and magnets. To request these quotes, I had to provide our Alpha contact, sales rep Ali Bittner, with the specific specs of each desired product (ex. the magnets needed to be 16”x16” with an 8”x8” square cut out, quantities, etc.). Once approved, I gave Ali the “ok” to start production. I then worked directly with Bill Will, the pre-press specialist, to ensure his proofs were correct and that production could commence. These signs are what you now see in and around the office. I designed and produced the product tags in-house using our laminator and cutting board.

The design challenges didn’t stop there - Mike Lambert of the TPM team reached out to me January 22 and asked for my help redesigning the vector icons used for the visualization tool. Mike and I Zoomed to go over the basic specs of the project and to give me a more detailed idea of what exactly I’d be designing, who exactly would be using it, and what exactly it would be used for. From what I was told, in video playback, there are icons that appear in the corners of the screen to denote things like if the car was in autonomous or manual mode, a speed limit sign reflecting the actual speed limit of the road the car was traveling on, a speedometer to capture how fast the car was actually moving, traffic light signals, and more. Mike also gave me a copy of the signs they were already using and asked for a more professional and well-integrated look. I designed multiple vectors in Adobe Illustrator and shared the proofs via a Slides doc. Over the course of a month, his team and I conversed back and forth on the Slides doc and within the ticket to make changes as necessary for the team’s ultimate utilization. While I’m unsure if all the icons have been used or will be used, I have seen some (ex. the auto/manual button and speed limit sign) appear on video playback of the car in our All Hands meetings, which has been extremely rewarding in itself. 

The five evacuation maps seen around our space are a product of collaboration between myself and Amanda Leight - she provided me with safety information that I designed into a readable map. Amanda first outlined what type of layout the maps should be placed on and what kind of information was necessary (starting points, escape routes, a meeting place, etc.). I took the routes and logistical info and transposed each into an easy to read map in case some type of evacuation of our space ever becomes necessary. This will also need to be done once we move to 3 Crossings + I have been nominated to take a trip up to New Stanton to design maps for that site as well. 

I designed both the t-shirts and badges for Argo Kids Takeover, as well as manned the check-in table for the children attending. I presented Mike Fitzpatrick with three different t-shirt ideas and proofs (designed in both Adobe InDesign and Illustrator) in a Slides doc. Once he chose the Big Car, Little Car model, I passed along the appropriate files to Zack Katic to send to our t-shirt vendor. The badges are modeled after ours, with a big “K” placed on the back to denote kid instead of the “E” or “C” to denote employee or contractor, respectively. I cut and organized these badges based on the RSVP attendee spreadsheet provided by Mike. On the day of the Takeover, I set up a check-in table right outside of our space and served as the children’s first point of contact. I distributed their badges, tracked attendance, and directed them to breakfast/their first activity. I also designed, sourced a vendor, and ordered the corn hole sets used at each site on Argo Kids Takeover. 

Another t-shirt I designed was a last minute request from Zack Katic for the interns starting in Pittsburgh next week (5/21/18). Per our in person conversation, Zack opened a ticket with the design style his team was interested interested in - I did my best to put an Argo spin on their idea, and presented him with a proof I created in Adobe Illustrator. After a couple rounds of edits, I presented him with a tentative finished design on Monday (5/14/18). He was pleased and approved the proof for production, so I sent along the EPS and PNG files. This project stemmed from Zack asking if I would be comfortable or interested in taking on more design responsibility for the company. While I would love taking on this responsibility, this needs to be approved by my new manager Kelly Mullins.

There are many other odd-jobs I have done related to design, including our out of order signage, cabinet labeling signage, reserved desk table tent signs, desk eviction table tent signs, SSID signs, etc. It’s also important to mention that my duties are not restricted solely to the Pittsburgh Site. I also provide design work for California, New Jersey, and Michigan as necessary. An example of this is providing each site with the SSID signs I first designed here in PIT. I designed, printed, cut, and mailed the signs to each site + provided specific information and instruction on which sign holders to purchase and how to hang them. I also design seven site specific menus each week.

Aside from the above special projects, my weekly responsibilities capture a whole different set of skills. From 8:30am to 12:30pm, I serve as receptionist. I am the first interaction employees, contractors, interns, visitors, candidates etc. have when they enter our space. It is my duty to greet everyone with a smile and help onsite visitors sign in. Every candidate is offered a parking pass (if applicable) and a bottle of water - they are invited to sit and wait for their respective party to escort them throughout our space. If I notice any candidate is exceptionally nervous, I offer small chit-chat to help ease their nerves. I feel as if it’s my job to ensure all visitors are greeted with a warm and open environment to feel as welcome as possible. 
 I take photos of each new hire upon arrival so he/she receive his/her badge same-day. Once the photo has been taken, I use Adobe Photoshop to edit out the background. While this may seem like an easy task, certain personal characteristics can make this task a bit time consuming. For example, I have frizzy wavy hair that sticks out in different ways around my head. Editing the space behind these unruly whispys requires at least three different Photoshop tools (eraser, background eraser, and magic eraser). If someone is bald, however, this task takes mere seconds to complete. To ensure each photo is up to Argo standards, I take my time and provide the best version possible to our IT team, who then prints out and activates the badge.

I also created a new employee master spreadsheet for internal use that contains start dates, names, parking locations (and lease numbers if applicable), fob numbers, and mapper info. I serve as the main point of contact between Argo and our parking manager over at the Hub, Denise. Denise has praised my communication skills, stating in an email on May 8 - “By the way Kelly….thank you SO much for providing all the required info every time! You’re making my life easier (smiley face).” I have also played a role in designating parking spots at our new location. Amy has asked for my assistance in acquiring, assigning, and maintaining record of all spots for Argo as a whole. I also manage building access for Crane + serve as a point of contact between the building manager and Argo. I request building fobs for new hires weekly.

Weekly tasks also include responding to and resolving internal questions and requests via our ticketing system; updating the master employee list I created + updating the facilities spreadsheets to reflect these changes; designing seven lunch menus (Crane, Depot, Commerce, Federal, New Stanton, New Jersey, Miami); continuing to work on conference room designs for Three Crossings; stocking the fridges twice a day; and providing support for any additional tasks (ex. Seuss Day, superstition signs) Amy dreams up. 

All in all, I feel I provide exceptional support to both the facilities team and all the teams across the office. I am eager to take on more responsibilities regarding not only design, but provide internal business support for the company as a whole. I am ready for any challenges thrown my way and am willing to adapt to the ever-changing circumstances surrounding the nature of this business and this position. According to the facilities job ladder, I am not only taking on next level facilities responsibilities, but also managing a good portion of our internal design - a role that doesn’t necessarily fit on any particular part of this ladder. I am interested to see how my unique skill set will be grow and continue being utilized in this growing company.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Working with Kelly has been a great asset to me as a member of the facilities team; she was my welcome buddy when I started in February and was a wonderful person to have contact with. She helped me get acquainted with the day to day workings of the Argo PIT office. I was able to use her as a resource for in many areas; from providing me with ins and outs of the reception desk to helping me learn where items & stock were in the office to pointing out the who’s who in the office. I always had a slack channel open to ping her questions and Kelly was wonderful about helping me with with anything I reached out to her about. She also had a direction to point me when she didn’t have the answer herself - and knowing where to head for an answer if you don’t have it can be as important as knowing the answer firsthand.

Kelly’s aptitude for design is where she truly shines in the team; she creates sharp, brand-recognizable designs that bring a cohesive look to the office and those touches are seen throughout the space. Signage that she has made is seen in the phone booths, in the conference rooms displaying the wifi info; on reserved and event signage; and on the lunch menus that she creates for seven different Argo sites; in all of these instances, the addition these signs brings a polished and professional look to the space.

The badge project that Kelly worked on is truly another feather in her cap. Badging and security is everyone's responsibility but who isn’t more apt to wear their badge when is is a well designed badge you can proudly wear. The city scape design work and the details that accent even the temp badges (like the crash test dummy outlines) make the Argo badge one that stands out as more than just another company badge.   

We are able to work well as part of the team, which is vital as Kelly and I share many of the stocking and reception coverage duties. We are able to work in seamlessly together to split stocking and desk coverage so that the office receives the best possible service. Additionally, when needed Kelly is flexible to help accommodate any changes in coverage to account for things that come up like events. She was a true team player this past March when she was able to focus in and keep the day to day facilities tasks running when I was out due to surgery, Tom was out to to illness and Amy was out due to a family illness. I know that this is a challenging task and Kelly was able to make sure that the day to day reception coverage and stocking happened, while also covering for other team member tasks (like taking the compost out) - it shows that she has a solid understanding of what needs to happen in and day (and an understanding of what her team does in a day to keep the space running) and highlights her ability to manage her time and be the consummate team player. This was no small feat and she deserves to be commended for it.

Kelly is also a key part of the new hire onboarding process from a facilities standpoint; she serves as the POC to both the LL/PM and the parking manager to ensure that main building access and parking access are granted to new hires which helps feed into creating seamless onboarding process. She also edits the badge photos so that badges are created with a crisp, identifiable photo on a clean background which helps photos be identifiable as possible (again, as security is a key factor for all of us, an identifiable badge is an asset).  

Another quality that I see in Kelly is her desire to ask questions and learn more about processes even when the task at hand might not be her sole responsibility. Case in point are the SDS binders and the Evac Maps. Kelly had not created an SDS binder for a space before and while she was not responsible for finding and printing the pages for the SDS binder; she took the time to ask me to explain what the binder was, how to find the information and why we have them in the site. I appreciate that she likes to understand the scope of a task and asks questions, so she not only understands what she is to do but why and how to do the task herself in the event she needs to do it again in the future solo.

Overall, it is a pleasure to work with Kelly and I look forward to continuing to work on projects with her.

Since then, she has completed many other design projects such as snack/kitchen labels, recycling/compost/trash program, wifi signage in all conference rooms, t-shirts and badging for Kids Takeover day, updating conference room maps around the office, etc. She knows how to design for a purpose as well as aesthetics. One example of her good design work is the recycling/compost/trash program. From where the labels were placed on the trash cans and throughout the office, color coding the different types of trash, and giving examples of what should go in each can -- she knows how important these pieces are for making daily tasks less complicated.

Kelly has also been a big contributor to the ""fun"" lunch themes. Whether it be decorating the office to creating interesting lunch menus, she has helped add some fun and humor to the office.

Kelly grew into her role at Argo quickly and within a couple weeks she was already a go-to for many people in the office when they needed help with something, even things that wouldn't typically fall under facilities. She assisted Zack K. and I by passing out t-shirt swag to everyone in the Pittsburgh office. This was a huge help during a very busy time for Zack and I.

Kelly is also the first point of contact for anyone coming to the office. She is very friendly and personable, which makes her a great fit for her reception duties. I have also enjoyed working with Kelly to complete different parts of event set up, including visitor badging, greeting guests for Pete and Bryan, conference room and food setup for special events, etc. She is always happy to help whenever help is needed.",,,Ashley Waller,awaller@argo.ai,Kelly Bennett,kbennett@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Kelly has been a great addition to the Argo team!  Her personality is infectious and her up beat attitude is exactly what the facilities team and the reception area needed!  

I was on the interview panel when Kelly interviewed.  From the time I walked into the conference room, I knew that Kelly would be a great addition to the team.  Truly, her positive attitude could not be overlooked!  Her smile lite up the room and could that girl talk!  :-) . But all of that was exactly what was needed for the position that she had applied for.  She was friendly and you could see that she wanted to be engaged in the conversation.  She asked questions and probed for details.  Again, everything that you want to see in a candidate!  

Once she was hired, all of the positive came with her...she has made so many positive contributions that it is hard to include all of them in a single review!

Kelly has great attention to details!  She can spot a typo or a misaligned line from a mile away!  Seriously, Kelly is a very talented graphic designer.   The first project that I worked with Kelly on was the redesign of the Argo badges.  Kelly was challenged with coming up with several options to present to the leadership team.  I loved working with her.  I am a pretty creative person and I find that when I am working with someone else who is also creative great things happen!  Kelly and I worked really well together reviewing and refining designs for the badges.  Kelly has a great ability to use the tools that she has to create amazing things.  She was able to take talking points and create a badge design that pictorially represented the conversation!  It was amazing!

Kelly has also helped the development team with their needs, this is another example of her being asked, with words, to create something and her ability to actually make it a reality!  She has tremendous design skills and she is willing to take a chance and she does not get upset if you ask her to make changes to what she has created.

Kelly always goes out of her way to give you options.  For example, I asked her to design the wireless SSID and Password signs for the conference rooms in the Pittsburgh office.  Not only did she design signs that were far superior to what was there (created by IT) but she also presented me with 4 different options!  It was not just a here you go, here is your sign, but it was here are some options that I thought you might like to review so that you can get exactly what you want!  We are now distributing these to all locations that need then, and Kelly is taking the lead on this task!

Kelly has made a tremendous impact on the professional look of Argo.  She has taken simple signs, not so simple signs and designed professional, easy to read and understand communications that have had a great impact on the organization.  They range from what is for lunch each week, to what to compost (I know that I needed that one) to what to do if there is an emergency.  

The funny part is that I have spent 4 paragraphs talking about tasks that Kelly was not actually hired to do.  This talent just happened to come along with the employee who has nailed her ""real"" job from day one!  

Kelly spends 1/2 of her time at the front desk as the Argo receptionist and does a great job!  In my positions at Argo, I have had many guests come through the front door and on a regular basis our guests comment on what an extremely nice person Kelly is and how helpful she is.  One person even asked where we found her, that he would take her in a heart beat.  I, of course, told him that she was not available!!  She is always professional and helpful with our guests!  Kelly does an awesome job!

Kelly also spends time supporting the stocking of snacks and drinks and the themed lunches and all hands that Argo provides to their employees.  Kelly takes this job very seriously.  She will stay late to make sure that the refrigerators are stocked and that the shelves are full.  She understands that it is an important part of her job and she takes it seriously.  Many people would be put off by this part of the job, but Kelly does not have a problem with it.  At any time, you could see her throwing cases of water onto her cart or soda or teas or any drink that may need to be refilled.  She is very conscientious of the stock and makes sure that it is clear what needs to be reordered!

I am thrilled to have Kelly as a member of my new team and I look forward to seeing her grow in her role!",,,Kelly Mullins,kmullins@argo.ai,Kelly Bennett,kbennett@argo.ai,General & Administrative,

Kelly was eager to help even though, to me, it seemed to be out of the scope of her normal job function.  At the start of the project, Kelly took the time and did a great job understanding the scope of the graphics we were looking for.  She provided great communication throughout the process letting us know the how work was progressing and if there was any delay due to other pop-up work coming in.  Kelly was very organized in the prioritization and delivery of her work and always let me know when part of the project was delivered or delayed.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"For areas of improvement, I would really like to push myself to become more involved and more comfortable with vendor relations. While Amanda is responsible for sourcing most vendors (aside from the print-related jobs I source), I think it’s important for me to learn how to properly manage business to business relationships from her. For example: I reached out to Alpha Graphics to receive a quote for a job Travis Kilpatrick had already quoted with a different vendor. Alpha ended up quoting twice as high as the original vendor, so Travis naturally went with the less expensive option. I would like to gain more experience on how to deal with situations like these. Alpha asked what they could do better next time, and I wasn’t quite sure how to respond. Amy stepped in to coach me for next time, giving me a better idea on how to negotiate pricing. Situations like these (especially involving money) are not the most comfortable to deal with, so I would like to have more practice in order to learn how to properly handle myself. 

I’m also learning how to better manage inventory and regulate overall company consumption (both regarding food and office supplies). This is essential to ensure Argo has the proper tools it needs to function productively. As an aside, I’ve also never been involved in a company move before. I am interested to see what facilities will be responsible for and how well we will execute. A lot of these tasks are new to me; but, I learn best by doing, so I am looking forward to growing to become a more valuable team member.",,,Kelly Bennett,kbennett@argo.ai,Kelly Bennett,kbennett@argo.ai,General & Administrative,

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"One area of improvement for Kelly would be confidence, especially when working with vendors; Kelly knows a lot more than she gives herself credit for but she can second guess herself a lot which slows her down and doesn’t give her answers as much weight as they would have it stated or written with more certainty and clarity. By continuing to become more comfortable with her contacts (such as Alphagraphics, the LL/PM and Denise in the Hub Parking), and possibly working with some new ones with the upcoming move, I think she will become more confident in the process of vendor relations.

I will support her own self evaluation  in learning more around the skills of vendor relations and negotiations.  She has had limited exposure to this in her current role so I could see the need for improvement in these areas.

She's always been accepting of my opinions and ideas, even when we didn't necessarily agree on how to handle a certain situation, and has encouraged me to take on more responsibility.  I've never found myself questioning where I stand with her or what her opinion of me might be, which is not something I could say about a majority of the people I've worked under in my career.

On multiple occasions, I needed IT's help on a few minutes' notice.  Kelly, as Director of IT, immediately dispatched a member of her team to assist with the technology needs.  As an example, Kelly organized her team's fun event activity.  The team left for the event around lunch time. At the same time, my computer's OS failed.   Kelly personally stayed behind to resolve my issue, while her team was participating in the fun activity. Kelly also asked one of her team members, Becky, to come back and assist me asap.

On a number of other occasions, Kelly delivered a very fast performance under a tight deadline. 
Kelly made it a priority to set up and attend weekly follow-ups with Legal to ensure that both department collaborate smoothly.  Due to Legal and IT working closely, we were able to quickly update NDA process and templates in the Envoy system.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Over the last 6 months, I have been involved in many successful projects that span the entire organization.  I have picked up not only IT responsibilities but also Facilities and Real Estate Development responsibilities.  

It has been exceptionally rewarding to witness the explosive growth of Argo.  I am proud to have lead the charge in establishing and implementing the robust IT  framework that enables continued growth of the organization to achieve Argo AI's mission in changing the world of transportation.  While I am sad to pass the torch on to my successor, I know that I have laid the framework for their success.

The following are examples of the work that I have lead and completed that I feel have made the biggest impact on the organization and the pursuit of the Argo mission.

**End User Services**

Procured, provisioned and delivered approximately 850 end points on time for every user to have a workstation on day one.  This has been in place and fully functioning since we began in January of 2017.

Negotiated stocking agreements for the hardware supply for all new hardware ensuring that IT would have supplies at all sites and could respond quickly when unexpected needs arise.  

Negotiated a cost plus model with the Dell hardware provider to ensure the best possible pricing as well as consistent pricing for the organization.

Revised the onboarding process so that every employee receives their fully functioning photo badge on day one, along with parking.  People Ops noted the immediate improvement in this process.  Michael Fitzpatrick:

Subject: Badging in Pittsburgh
To: Matt Williams <mwilliams@argo.ai>


Hi Matt, 

I just wanted to call out the major improvement to the new hire badging system here in Pittsburgh. 

I know IT recently took over the responsibility and there was an immediate change for the better. 

Badging used to be an uncertainty if it was going to be received on the first day. 

Now, it is handed over, ready to go in the IT orientation meeting in the morning. 

I just wanted to take the time to call out a job well done and a flexible team that made a quick impact. 

Mike 


Establishment and stocking of Technology Supply cabinets and successfully transitioned the process to Procurement.

Encryption of all laptop hard drives in Argo owned laptops.  Provided two solutions to meet the needs of the user community, software and hardware encryption.  

Patch management ground work established.  This will enable IT to react quickly to security upgrades as well as improving the ability to inventory software installations as well as improving the ability to push out controlled updates and products.

**Physical Security**

Took over physical security from Facilities providing consistency across all locations so that a single badge provides entrance to all Argo offices for all Argo employees.

Distributed updated badges with a new design providing a more secure badge platform as well as a more complex design making it harder to counterfeit badges and easier to identify the employment state of the bearer.

Created policy and protocol to follow for the distribution of temporary badges.  Procured secure card/key boxes to protect temporary badges and any hard keys used at each site.  Established the process to have the temp badges activated so that activated badges were not being stored.  You must request activation if you are going to hand out a temporary badge.

Enhanced the physical security platform:  added the capabilities to provide more personal security for first person in/last person out support.  We have installed panic buttons in all of our large depot/terminal/garage locations.  These devices were installed in multiple locations throughout the facilities as well as being available to be worn on your wrist as the first person in or the last person out allowing for immediate emergency notification to authorities if needed.  These are silent alarms that notify the local authorities with a heightened response signal. 

Identified the minimal requirements for video surveillance at all Argo locations.  Require video surveillance at all points of entrance and egress.  Established minimal retention for all videos.

**Access for external users, contractors and partners**

There was a need to provide a means for sharing Argo data with external parties, contractors and partners.  I worked to provide a safe, secure way for Argo development teams to be able to share and receive data from external parties and to mitigate the risk of accidental exposure of Argo IP to external parties. Was able to provide a means to share data that is easily integrated into our current workflow that is easy to use and easy to administer.
 
#1 objective is to safeguard Argo IP

Google:  Established a second Google domain xagro used to give email and data access to external users.  Users are not able to access any data in the Argo domain and this approach limits the possibility of accidental exposure of Argo data. Administered via a single Google Admin console so no additional processes needed.  Teams can both share and receive data in this location

Slack:  Created a second instance of slack that allows for multiple workspaces while managing both within a single console.  This approach limits accidental exposure of Argo IP but provides more flexibility for the teams and end users, ie. they can have multiple channel access but without chance of exposing Argo IP.
Argo employees can have access to multiple workspaces allowing for collaboration and communication with external teams.

**Policy**

ISP gap remediation:  worked through the last two quarters to remediate gaps and to ensure the security of Argo IP.  Provided an All Hands training session on the ISP.

Data Retention Policy:  Worked with Legal to establish the list of data categories at Argo and the retention period for each type of data.  

Software Licensing policy:  Worked with Accounting, Procurement and Legal to establish the policy around the procurement and approval of terms for all software licenses used at Argo.

Physcial Security policy:  Established the minimal standards for physical security at all Argo locations.  In addition we educated and provided documentation on training for physical security protocols for all Argo employees.

Employee Handbook:  Collaborated with People Ops to establish the IT and Physical Security sections of the Employee Handbook.

**10 locations**

Provided the computing  and physical security infrastructure for 10 Argo locations standardizing the infrastructure and the services needed to support the success of the Argo mission.

**New Locations:  MTV 150, New Stanton, Miami,  New Jersey**

MTV 150:  brought up wireless networking to relieve the stress of the overflowing work space in Suite 100 prior to the space being brought up to Argo standards.  Provided Zoom functionality earlier than move in to also eliminate the stress of space shortage in Suite 100.  Supported the complete upgrade of space in 150 to support the rapid unexpected and unprojected growth of the MTV office.

New Stanton:  provided support of the infrastructure as well as the computing needed in the new test site for Argo.  Provided physical security both internally to the office space as well as external to the test track.  Provided the entire computing infrastructure including wired and wireless networking, ingest capabilities to upload data to AWS, scratch storage for quick downloads of car data for testing, zoom capabilities as well as wireless networking at the test track.

Miami: Temporary computing capabilities within the first week of signing the lease for the space including fiber connectivity, network stack provisioned providing both wired and wireless networking, Ingest capabilities as soon as the building was available, Envoy for singing in guests/contractors, temporary zoom room to allow interviews to take place, represented Argo in the design meetings with Ford and Ghafari.  Collaborated with Tony Warywoda and Mike Vernau to establish the needed functionality of the terminal.

New Jersey:  Supported the onboarding of an additional 35 employees acquired via the purchase of PLI by Argo.  Provided Argo owned equipment for use on Argo projects and stood up the Argo network while continuing to support the legacy PLI network so that they could complete their government contracts.  We also provided and implemented a working plan needed to safeguard controlled data to meet the DFARS requirements by December 31, 2017 so that PLI could fulfill their contractual obligations with the government.

PIT Depot:  Refine security requirements to meet the needs of the occupants by installing video doorbells so that they could identify visitors prior to opening the doors.  Working with Vehicle Ops to refine the technology needed in space to perform training and dissemination of data to the contractors.  Helped to establish the requirements for the Triage team limiting accidental data exposure while enabling them to complete their work.  Added additional data and power resources to support developers at the depot.

**Real Estate development - 3 Crossings, Page Mill, New Jersey**

3 Crossings:  Provided the design for the computing infrastructure and physical security to be established in the new Argo PIT office.  Worked and collaborated directly with the Moss Architect group, the Oxford Development group and the Rycon Construction group to pull together all requirements for this site, well beyond IT, including the construction and design of the space, design decisions, furniture selections and security.  Took the project to deal review for approval for the final budget needed to deliver the building and move the PIT office to this location.  In addition I collaborated with IVCI and Zoom to design and implement the All Hands video wall and video conferencing infrastructure.

Page Mill:  Reviewed options for the new location of the MTV office needed to relieve the space constraints and consolidate the diverse office locations to bring the team together.  Worked with external counsel on the terms and conditions of the construction contract.  Partnered with Moss Architects and XL Construction to perform the first round of test fits for the space and to establish a GMP budget for the work to be completed.

New Jersey:  Worked with Mark Itzler and Yves to establish the requirements for the new office space.  Collaborated with the Broker, Jon Marks and Moss Architects to test fit the needs in a the new location.  Determined that the initial space was not large enough.  Worked with team to determine the right sizing and new test fit out.

You can tell that IT is a properly led team because each and everyone of them are nonstop go-getters. I've seen Kelly in action, and she is extremely detail oriented and efficient.  Since she is that way, the rest of her team is that way. Every time I've created an IT ticket, her team has responded back in the same day. This is awesome considering they could make the Ops team feel like outsiders since we are in a different building. You can tell she trains the IT team to have a customer first mindset and it is evident in the pride they take in executing tasks efficiently.

Kelly did a phenomenal job of getting the depot operational for the Ops team. IT literally had a large role in the setup of the whole building.  Badge systems, alarm system, TVs on the walls, remote access to the TVs, zoom rooms, ingest servers, deployment servers, and the continual maintenance and stocking of vehicle laptops and supplies.  Kelly herself was instrumental in scheduling and interacting with vendors, attending meetings, and implementing the policies and procedures of all of the above.

Kelly is a pleasure to work with.  One of the bummers about working in a separate building is not getting to talk to her as frequently as I used to.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"This is as much my fault as IT, but IT/Ops should probably set up a monthly meeting to discuss current IT issues and any other IT related items.  This will help to mitigate the accumulation of issues over time, and enable IT to have insight into future Ops plans so they can plan accordingly.  As highlighted above, IT is present all around the depot.  There are many legacy policies that I feel can be changed now.  We were rightfully very strict about access to the server rooms before, but now Ops handles all ingests.  Soon, ingest responsibilities will be solely VO I's (<--FTE Argo employee), so it should be standard when a VO I comes onboard, they get access to the room.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Ken has been instrumental in improving our interactions with Ford on Tiara cooling and cleaning.  Ken has provided good insight into analysis of the design.  Making the correct connections within Ford, much more testing has been accomplished for both categorizing how to define future thermal specifications and measuring Z1 airflow.  

Ken has a great ability in working through the process of how to best define requirements and is bridging the important gap with cleaning and cooling between hardware and system level requirements that need to be considered.  

Ken is providing valuable insight to the testing design and specification development for the sensor cleaning system.  Working through assessments such as the number of cleaning cycles based on tank size is crucial for a successful design.",,,Beth Ballard,eballard@argo.ai,Kenneth Jackson,kjackson@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Ken has been extremely helpful in getting the Z2 requirements better structured and well-defined. Ken's experience with Ford requirements and ESOWs has helped us to create a much stronger framework for the requirements and present them in a way with which Ford and automotive vendors are familiar. 

Ken has also been of great assistance in communications with Ford and understanding working through the right channels to get things done efficiently and clearly. As an example, I was struggling to get thermal testing lined up for Z1. We were originally working through PMT1 and and struggling to connect with the right people within Ford and the project was pushed back multiple months. Once Ken came on board he was able to get us connected directly to members of the TSE team and get the request into the correct channels and in the correct format and get the testing started in less than two weeks. Ken is now leading the effort to roll the results of some of the testing back into the Ford EY-0128 requirements.

Ken also has extensive experience in automotive cooling systems and I find it very useful to brainstorm with him on different design approaches. For example, liquid cooling of the tiara components frequently comes up in design conversations and I was able to gain a much better understanding of what a liquid cooled tiara solution might look like, some of the challenges that would need to be overcome, and how feasible it would be to validate.",,,Dustin Yautz,dyautz@argo.ai,Kenneth Jackson,kjackson@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Ken is a fantastic engineer and teammate. Things I really appreciate:
1. Ken is always willing to dispense information/stories about (1) what metrics Ford the organization and major Ford team optimize on and (2) what building a production vehicle is ACTUALLY like (what goes wrong on the line? How can it be fixed? How does that feed back into the deadlines that Argo is working to now?).  This is particularly valuable for me given that I do not have experience with the Ford culture/ethos, and have also never worked for a large OEM or large-scale production hardware company - knowing what matters to them helps me understand where Ford groups are coming from and why certain requests seem to concern them more than others...
2. Ken is really willing to give tutorials on things like engine performance and can simplify things down to a level where I can understand them despite never having taken a motor class - this tutorial meant that I can make use of Ford's data on max engine performance, which means I can perform correct bounding scenario calculations. 
3. Ken has done a great job of rolling into the company and putting together a thermal working group with HW/Ford and sensor cleaning team with Dustin. ",,,Nivedita Chandrasekaran,nchandrasekaran@argo.ai,Kenneth Jackson,kjackson@argo.ai,Software,

Your climate/cooling/EPE experience and expertise has been an incredible addition to the team. You've also been willing to take on any and all tasks that come your way. From JAMA to CAN interfaces, always willing to go outside your comfort zone and contribute to whatever the team needs.

I am much more confident and comfortable that our compute and sensing thermal strategies and architectures will be robust and meet requirements with you leading them. 

Your experience and knowledge of the Ford systems and engineers will also make our work with them much more efficient and effective.

I also like how outgoing you are in creating and making new relationships with the Argo team like Dustin, Beth, Ryan Davis, etc. You understand the value of communication and relationships.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Since joining 3 months ago, I’ve spent a good amount of time ramping up on AV technology and the Argo AI platform architecture.  I now feel much more comfortable with the AV system compared to even a month or two ago and believe that I am in the position to be able to contribute at a more rapid pace going forward.

The majority of my direct contributions so far have been on the SGU development and on system architecture for z2 and later.

My SGU related contributions include:
- Developed FPGA IP to support SGU bringup and to help clear any roadblocks for the DornerWorks ISP development.  This included implementing a serial I/O toolkit design, a SGMII bridge design with Petalinux support, and a TPG/VDMA/PCIe DMA design on the iVeia x8 SoM.
- Helped to manage the DornerWorks engagement.  This included requirements alignment, evaluating releases, and coordinating/running weekly sync up meetings.

My contributions to the Z2+ AVS architecture include:
- Collaborated with the SW infrastructure team and perception team to understand compute requirements and to help drive compute architecture decisions for Z2+.
- Evaluated Intel Spring Hill architecture.  To help steer Intel roadmap decisions, I published a white paper to Intel that outlined Argo AI inference requirements.
- Conducted Intel processor trade study, which will drive computing decision for Z2 to J1.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Since joining the team in January, I have established myself as the technical lead for all camera-related activities at Argo. I have done so by quickly learning about the state of the program and decisions to-date, establishing collaborative relationships with hardware and cross-functional team members, and engaging closely with key component suppliers (Magna, OnSemi, Ambarella, TI) and our Ford counterparts.

In addition, I took on management responsibilities for Rick D'Alo and have provided guidance and feedback on his projects. I have looked for opportunities for Rick to apply his expertise in optics at both the lens level as well as stretching into illumination design.

Specific personal accomplishments and projects include the following:

On Z0, I investigated image quality feedback from software teams, dug into the camera software to identify fixes (to black level, color calibration, and exposure control), tested them on the sensor bench and via VTRs, and submitted a PR to land fixes. This was a multi-week effort that allowed me to gain a better understanding of the software architecture of our vehicle and make connections with various cross-functional teams including perception, machine learning, calibration, infrastructure, and test ops.

On Z1, I have led technical discussions and design reviews (for lens, PCB, and module architecture) both internally and externally, and supported commercial negotiations with Magna on ESOWs and DCRs. Upon reviewing our Z1 ESOW I identified a number of test gaps and documented required coverage at the vendor as well as drove the creation of comprehensive test plans for characterization at Argo. I also recognized an early risk in the lens protective cap that had not been properly vetted by Magna. In bringing attention to this component and the associated mechanical/environmental risks we were able to drive Magna and Sunny to put in place plans for risk mitigation.

On Z2, I led a trade study for near-field stereo camera options, which required establishing contact with a number of new Tier 1s and stereo processor vendors, procuring and evaluating test hardware, and reviewing architecture, software, and integration options with the wider team.  Building relationships with other Tier 1s has been valuable to understand their roadmaps and technologies as they might apply to future projects. Other Z2 activities I have led included deep dives on the custom AR1212 sensor architecture with OnSemi and selection of an architecture for in-cabin monitoring.",,,Koji Gardiner,kgardiner@argo.ai,Koji Gardiner,kgardiner@argo.ai,Hardware,

He quickly came up to speed on the current state of development with the Tier 1 camera vendor, and by the end of his first week was driving key decisions to keep the Z1 far field camera program on track.  He has also added a significant amount of coverage for camera testing and validation to help ensure the success of camera hardware at Argo.

One of Koji's main leadership strengths is his ability to persuade without trying to intimidate or promote confrontation, both internally and externally to Argo.  His contributions to the interpersonal relationships between Argo, Magna, and Ford have been a strong asset to the program by keeping key personnel on all sides engaged and informed of the what and why behind our specifications and requirements.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Koji has been able to jump right in and make an immediate impact on the organization. He has taken over the responsibly of technical lead for camera as soon as he started in January with minimal need for a transition period. Koji was really thrown in at the deep end as he was asked to manage a struggling program and turn it around towards success. The relationship with our Tier1 partner has always been a struggle and Koji has been able to graceful navigate all the obstacles that have been thrown at him. More specifically he has been able to keep a close on our Tier1 partner which requires constant attention and management. He has also been able to efficiently interact with our main camera component vendors and made sure to also keep them in check when they had the tendency to over-promise and under-deliver.

Koji has shown a lot of professionalism, great attitude and passion but above everything else, impeccable technical knowledge. I am happy to have Koji on our team and will welcome any opportunity to interact with him.",,,Michel Laverne,michel@argo.ai,Koji Gardiner,kgardiner@argo.ai,Hardware,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"I worked closely with Koji on Z1-related camera items, both internal to Argo and externally with Magna/OnSemi. I find Koji very thorough, objective and practical in driving camera module requirements. In the process, Koji takes respectful and balanced approach that results in effective interpersonal relationships to get things done - meeting camera technical requirements and schedule. One example that comes to mind that typifies Koji’s approach is DCRs with Magna in order to get comprehensive test coverage on Z1 cameras. Koji established the must-have items, did an internal review and explained to Magna. Another example is to probe Magna’s supply chain partner (Sunny) to better effect the camera design. This is work in progress, making Z2 design more effective. Koji is also a firm believer in teamwork and practices it on regular basis, always joining in at the hip with supply chain counterpart to drive the best deals for Argo. This was obvious when we were driving the ED&T details with Magna on DCRs.

Similar to what I mentioned on Z1, Koji’s rigor was obvious for Z2 activities. One example to mention is AR1212 deep dive at ON Semi. Koji prepared a detailed document that helped us with evaluating the design of AR1212 image sensor, getting into subsystem details (pixel architecture, interfaces, ASIC, etc). When Koji is prepared to this extent, he is able to command respect across the table and build credibility.",,,Wahid Umerani,wumerani@argo.ai,Koji Gardiner,kgardiner@argo.ai,Hardware,

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"There are a couple of areas that Koji could increase that impact that he has. First, is by more direct involvement with the Detection team, who are the main consumers of camera data, but who have been oddly content with the lousy data coming out of our Z0 cameras. One way to do this is to poke one's nose in the log data and see the inputs and outputs of Detection. There is always a danger of walls arising between teams and consumers of data becoming fatalistic about the inputs they receive (it is what it is). Koji has engaged with the Detection team already on the changes he made to the black level and target intensity, but I would like to see more. That leads to the second area: learn to use the software stack to enable both more direct testing and the development of an understanding of where camera issues are causing real grief. I would like to see Koji invade the software area to a greater degree. Knowing the software stack and the playback system enables poking around in logs that might seem to be not in one's direct responsibility. For example, grab some of the suspicious PCEs and see how the camera data might have played a role and what can be done.",,,Michael Happold,mhappold@argo.ai,Koji Gardiner,kgardiner@argo.ai,Hardware,

Reviewed mask GDS for tape out approval.  I am very experienced in the GDS mask review process and found several errors that were not consistent with the WPS and/or the CDD that would have impacted the process down stream. This would have included catastrophic wafer failure and/or additional process cost to resolve the issues.

Working with the team has been a great benefit, however the execution and release of the 512x2 Front illuminated Detector array has slipped, due to foundry mis-communication and lack of understanding their process portfolio and capabilities. There are many obstacles in the path of developing the detector. Schedules slip and we, the team, all share responsibility for this. ""Changes "" are presented at the ""11th hour"" and the process design needs to be reviewed and revamped several times. The difficult foundry communication also contributes to the responsibility of this issue. Communication is better, but still a little strained. We as a team need to re-evaluate the manner in which we communicate with the foundry and the type of documentation we present to the foundry. Since I have the most experience with the fab foundry and processing, I should have been more pro-active in communicating my concerns to the team and communicated via email, if time did not permit during the meetings.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Notable Contributions and Organizational Impact

In the last six months our team has transitioned from developing the first implementation of a detection system to designing more features and sub-systems for the next phase of the module. The following are my contributions towards these goals which I believe lays out my case for promotion from a Level 4 to a Level 5 in this review period.

I led the research committee meetings and independently submitted over six proposals in a span of two meetings among which the following approaches were approved and further studied - a confidence smoothing approach to reducing flicker in the predictions of the detection system, a convolutional lstm variant of the model that would integrate temporal information to make predictions, low-cost image segmentation system that segments objects as foreground vs background within a bounding box. During the process of iterating and building a better detection system, I identified a key drawback of no standardized implementation of the mean average precision metric in our AV repo. In order to standardize the comparison of different models, I contributed the first implementation to compute the mAP metric for a detection system within our AV repo.

Over the last six months I have gained expertise in a variety of different deep neural network training platforms.  I contributed the first version of code that leverages Amazon’s cloud formation template to launch through a script several interconnected servers that can be used for distributed training of large deep learning models. Building on top of this tool, the data team was able to reduce the training time of Argo production model from 7 days to 4.5 days.  I researched and presented material on the optimization challenges of training distributed models that made the entire team aware of the difficulties in scaling and also provided useful strategy for successfully training large scale models in a distributed fashion. I put together a general purpose tool to convert single shot object detection (ssd) models from Mxnet( Amazon backed deep learning framework) to Caffe and created the first ever open-source contribution of Argo. While working with engineers from Amazon on this topic, here’s the response we got on availability of the tool from an engineer from Amazon,  ‘On the topic of model conversion, I wanted to note that Indu has had success with recognition models such as Resnet, GoogleNet etc. but as you heard, not on SSD models’. Creation of this tool required understanding the nuances in the implementation of multiple deep learning frameworks and identifying critical differences in implementation details. I worked along with legal and IT teams to set up a protocol for future open source releases including the creation of an open-source release form for Argo.

I participated in a cross-team effort to evaluate Google Cloud Platform for machine learning. I stood up an entire detection pipeline on argo data, including getting all the training data compatible with Tensorflow tfrecords and evaluated the training time and accuracy of the network in a variety of different host machine configurations. I evaluated tensor processing units for training models, which could potentially provide millions of dollars in cost savings for neural network training and communicated key benchmarking requirements to the Google team. I surfaced problems with the detection api for distributed data parallel training of high resolution images to the engineers at Google and communicated the key requirements to their team. During this effort, I was the single key contributor from my team at Argo and I brought several useful insights from this exercise to our team and also communicated key system requirements to the Google engineers.

I worked on geometric segmentation methods that could potentially replace the current segmentation pipeline. I wrote tools in C++ to extract the labelled dataset and performed point cloud processing using the PCL library. During this process we discovered shortcomings in the metrics code to evaluate segmentation methods and gained useful insight that could be leveraged in future work. Within a short period of time, I was able to familiarize myself with the segmentation code base under tracking in av, extract data and set up a procession pipeline in C++ to do point cloud processing. During this process I gained useful working knowledge on lidar datasets and expanded my programming skills to learn more C++.

I am currently working on an important submodule of the detection system - the 3D detection pipeline. This module is the first system that can learn from labelled lidar datasets and detect objects on the road using both lidar and camera sensors. This is also the first sub-module of the detection system that will predict heading direction of objects on the road. This system will serve as a key component for the safe operation of Argo vehicles in low lighting conditions. A preliminary version has already been implemented and tested on publicly available dataset. Currently, I am working on training and evaluating this model on ARGO dataset. I am primarily responsible for the design of the algorithm, data munging and organizing, offline training and validation and onboard implementation. I have made great progress on this project in a short period of time and am excited for the positive impact of this sub-module on the entire perception stack. Here are the links to the design documents and presentations that I independently drove:

Team Work and Communication 

The tools I developed in the last quarter of 2017, were built upon and iterated by the perception data and infrastructure team this year. A model management tool that I researched and introduced to the team has been widely used by team mates for traffic light classification and detection model management. We are in the process of setting up an in-house hosted version of this tool. This tool has enabled the team to manage and compare hundreds of different models and has repeatedly been acknowledged to be a useful interim solution for our team by several team mates.

In an effort to improve cross-team interaction I have pro-actively reached out to members outside of my team to understand the problems they solve and how machine learning might fit in their work. For example, I set up bi-weekly meetings with Michael Happold on stereo processing, helped Sam from the LIDAR team on computing SNR for the LIDAR returns and suggestions for detecting spikes in the returns. I have also had regular meetings with the faculty advisors of ARGO during the first quarter of this year. Recently, when our team decided to switch to a unified training platform, I presented arguments for why the proposed platform may not be optimal and was able to work with the team and converge on a solution that addressed the needs of all members of our team. During this process, I was able to respectfully put forward my disagreements with the team and arrive at a common middle-ground that worked out for everybody in the team.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Lakshmi has worked on a variety of projects, from research projects on temporally recurrent models for recognition to infrastructure-based projects that explored model translation between ML frameworks, as well as cloud-based processing.

Temporally recurrent models addressed shortcomings of the current perception stack, such as temporally unstable detections (""flickering""). They also provided instance labels over time, which could be useful to downstream customers such as tracking and prediction. Such appearance-based tracking cues are not used in the current perception stack, but seem like they would be vital at some stage (e.g., discriminating between two cars based on their color).

Of particular note was the exploration of lidar-based processing, a new sensor modality for the ML team. While low-level geometric clustering methods did not seem to improve upon prior tools, the current focus on deep LIDAR pipelines is exciting and promising.

In the coming months, I plan to learn and improve my C++ skills. I would also like to improve my PR cadence cycle to be in small chunks of code, instead of a fully complete library.

* During the work on lidar segmentation, I was at times blocked by another team member's work. While I initiated meetings to clarify and brainstorm the details of the metrics he implemented , I think I held back on initiating the implementation myself, thinking that it might step on his responsibilities. I eventually took on the work myself, however I think I should have instead taken over the work earlier than I did to accelerate that project forward.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Through the last evaluation period, I've designed and implemented tools, techniques, and systems to unblock time-critical efforts including log ingest from Pittsburgh, Triage, and Mapping.  I've put together the policies, guidance and the tooling for managing raw log data (~8PB) in S3 while controlling cost (approximately 47.6k saved per month assuming full utilization of two DX).  I've provided a mechanism and the tooling for engineers at Argo to share large amounts of data with each other.   I've continued to improve and maintain core tooling for working with logs and developing against log data at scale.  I brought the design and road-map for the sensor data mining platform through review with very little modification.  I worked with recruiting to revamp the software org's new interviewer training and have led the training sessions since.

**Ingest/Upload**
Ingest early design, transitioned to new owner and supported through transition/knowledge transfer. 

Mentored an intern through first major re-implementation/improvement of ingest binary and then follow-on feature improvements under direction of new owner. 

Stepped in as on-call for ingest through the end of February while new owner was coming up to speed, implemented fail-over for ingest stack preventing 6 outages.  Supported migration to new network architecture including coordinating reconfiguration of switch to improve utilization of upload pipes and prevent ops from having to nurse bricks through serially.

**Log storage/management**
Designed/Implemented tiered log retention and the tools to manage to improve utilization of AWS resources.  Served as go-to person for most questions related logs.  Wrote tools (uploadit.py, tagit.py, downloadit.py) and articles to manage/work with logs.  

Set up and wrote tools to manage user-specific (argoai-scratch: 0 maintenance, just add a policy to an IAM) storage space in AWS.

**Developer Infrastructure & Triage**
Designed and implemented cloud replay service (and supporting pipelines/processes), unblocking triage and allowing anyone with a VNC client to replay logs with no other installation/configuration.  This was considered risky and there was a lot of skepticism around whether this could be accomplished.
* Services ~135 log-scoped sessions a week.

Designed and implemented log slicing service.
* Used to unblock mapping and has since been integrated into their build workflow.
* Improved triage latency, allowing developers to request a log be sliced and then be notified via slack when done.
* Supports golden data set OKRS and has already been integrated into TL tools, integration into prediction and tracking as well.
* ~50 slices a week.  

Authored and maintainer for four core argo tools (transitioned since end of this evaluation period): downloadit, cloudit, tagit, uploadit.
 
Authored various docs on how to use each of these tools and hosted workshops/presentations/office hours.  I've also consulted on the design on a number of projects that are building off of these tools directly or have integrated similar techniques.

**PDM** 
Designed sensor data mining platform, a system that provides for the scalable extraction, storage of, and arbitrary manipulation of sensor data for Perception's use.  Design brought through review to approval with relatively little modification.  Currently in early implementation.

**Extracurricular**
Worked with recruiting to revamp software interview training and led training for new interviewers.

Mentored intern through contributions to both Log ingest and Mapping.

Coordination w/ GCP through evaluation and infrastructure evaluation of GCP vs AWS.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Larry has implemented several high profile, mission critical projects for the organization over this last review period. He has remained the Go to person for several mission critical technologies including ingestion and the triage / playback pipeline. Specific accomplishments in these areas are as follows:

Playback tooling & Triage - Larry designed, developed and deployed our cloud based triage / playback service that is in use across the organization today. He took this high profile feature from the POC stage all the way through production and it is in use by the triage and engineering team today. As part of this playback pipeline, Larry implemented scripts and tooling for instance provisioning and log slicing that allows us to efficiently copy only the parts of the logs we need.

Log Storage - Larry designed and implemented our initial log retention policy and associated tooling to support more efficient utilization of our AWS resources. Additionally larry wrote scripts downloadit, uploadit and tagit to allow engineers to efficiently work with logs in the cloud.

Ingestion - Larry helped transition the ingestion pipeline work he was guiding to Lee's offboard team. During this period there were several high profile disruptions and Larry jumped in(working long/late hours) to help keep this early infrastructure up and running.

One final area I'd like to call out that I've seen significant improvement on since last review cycle is minimizing the amount of work in progress Larry has had. He has done a much better job of focusing on a smaller number of projects and driving those to conclusion.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Larry is an incredibly strong engineer with the unique pairing of technical design acumen that can see around corners and correctly predict outcomes and the ability to own, execute, and communicate on projects that is essential to achieve success in a large, complex organization.  These skillsets are hard to find together and it comes through in the projects Larry works on.

- Ingest: Data ingest was an area that had complex requirements well outside a typical software developer's domain: infrastructure complexity and costs, personnel considerations, process and procedure implications, and so on.  Larry designed, tested, and deployed HW and SW solutions for this project that far exceeded the expectations of an SDE II.  He worked with IT on network requirements and coached interns on taking up development work after the initial implementation.  Throughout the project, Larry was a resource I could go to for sound advice on performance and risks and know that the answer was thoroughly considered and accurate.  On one occasion, Larry correctly suggested a networking technique to help reduce upload errors that both the most senior lead overseeing the project and the IT group thought wouldn't work.  This is atypical and demonstrates Larry's design and technical strengths.

- Triage VNC: When it was determined that the current triage platform was not adequately meeting users' needs and could not iterate fast enough to close the gaps, the organization was seeking a new method to quickly achieve improvements.  It was known that the Argonaut tooling provided many of the desired capabilities, but making it accessible from a web page was not straightforward and had issues.  Larry had the technical know-how and design skills to determine feasibility of accessing the tool via VNC, including all driver compatibility and performance considerations, and executed implementation swiftly.  He remained confident in the solution throughout challenges, communicated progress, and built significant new capabilities that others may have deemed unrealistic.  This demonstrated Larry's combination of technical skill, technology assessment abilities, and senior level leadership.

- Project planning: Larry took ownership of project planning for the current quarter for his team while his manager was out.  He compiled a roadmap and summary of the work to be performed and presented this information to leadership, information which was typically presented by SW leads for the other teams.  This demonstrates Larry's deep knowledge of his entire problem domain, its dependencies, and impact on the org, and was for a team he had been with for only a short while.

- Mentorship: Larry is a strong mentor and attempts to connect with others where it is beneficial to the individual and the org.  He has been an invaluable resource for myself for learning about tooling, systems, and teams since joining the company, and proactively reaches out to myself and others to educate or unblock issues.  This is another trait of a more senior engineer.",,,Randy Schultheis,rschultheis@argo.ai,Larry Jackson,lmj@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"Estimates:  
I've gone against my gut a few times and been overly optimistic on timelines.  The projects have ultimately taken about the original (more conservative) estimate.  I need to do better a better job of managing expectations (including making sure my confidence of the estimate is known and understood) and sticking to it.

I also sometimes make optimistic estimates.  I need to protect for risk more aggressively.

Communication of Priorities:  I interact with large cross-sections of the org and often get asked to help with efforts that are blocked, often without them necessarily having an understanding of my role/responsibilities (I've been sincerely asked if I was floating engineer).  Certain asks should be pushed through my manager, but communicating my priorities earlier should help people understand the priority of their ask relative to what I'm working on.  I also need to do better proxying the decision through to my manager when the ask will have an effect on the timelines I've communicated with him.",,,Larry Jackson,lmj@argo.ai,Larry Jackson,lmj@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,manager,,,,Etienne Jacques,ejacques@argo.ai,Larry Jackson,lmj@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Larry has very good intuition about how technically complex and time consuming the software projects he works on are. From my experience working with him his initial estimates are actually very reasonable about how long things should take, and how much technical risk is associated with them.  What I have seen, is that when Larry gets pressured to deliver on tighter timelines, he tends to back away from his original(and like i said, often correct) estimates on how much time a project will take to complete.  A specific example of this would be the rollout of cloudit for triage playback. We had an initial conversation about the timeline for this project, the plan was reasonable . and I believe Larry estimated 4-6 weeks for the first production viable version. Under pressure from senior management I believe the commitment turned into 2 weeks. And in the end this project actually took about 4 weeks to get the first version rolled out at an acceptable level of quality for the triage team to use. 

Larry should focus on communicating more frequently and effectively on the projects he is working on(particularly communicating up), and assert himself when it comes to committing to deadlines/scope for projects. Communicating and managing the scope of the projects you work on more effectively will enable you to have even great organizational impact.

I only could speak about the area I had direct visibility, which is the jobs platform. The entire project was from his proactive communication with many functional teams, abstracting the common pattern from various requirements, and coming up the idea of a generic platform to support massive parallel task execution. It was a brilliant idea and more importantly he single-handed its initial implementation within a week, which was very impressive and directly contributed to Argo's meeting 2017's OKR on mileage at the last month. After the jobs platform team got established and took over most of the development work, Lee still actively got involved in major technical designs and directly participated in tough technical challenges.
Lee has good management skills and an open mind to foster the growth of every his team member. During the re-organization of triage team, he welcomed all of us and provided opportunities for all of us working on areas we are interested. Lee also realized the distance of MTV team to the core AV team and lack of first-handed experience to Argo's car. Hence he came up with the idea to have the entire MTV team to visit Pittsburgh office and the outcome turned out to be very good.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,report,"This review describes only interaction between me and Lee since I have no visibility of his full scope of work.

Conversation with Lee during hiring manager interview was one of the main reasons why I've joined Argo. Yes, self-driving car is hot topic but I was aware of the fact that my skill set is not something strictly applicable to self-driving cars. One of my friend asked me if my work have been different if Argo was growing chicken instead of doing self-driving cars and with certain simplifications the answer is ""no"". If not the conversation with Lee I would probably continue interviewing with different companies and it's hard to say what would be final decision. Things that were important to me in that conversation:
 * Technical level: I got an impression that Lee has good technical background since he gave good specific answers to my questions. So my expectation was that I'm joining the team of true professionals
 * Management level: Lee mentioned that he thinks he figured out the way how to create good environment for engineers: give necessary tools and challenging problem. My observation is that team management in technology companies is often quite bad because of managers completely lacking any management skills to a degree when they can't even reflect that fact (known as Dunning–Kruger effect). Lee's statement meant for me that he is thinking critically about this topic
 * Attitude towards people: Lee asked the question what I would like to be doing in the future and I got an impression that it wasn't ""marketing"" question  - content mattered. And I thought that it mattered because Lee wanted to make sure that my goals and company direction are aligned or could be aligned - so it is not a general ""caring about people"" but practical question to make sure that our collaboration is ""win-win"" for both sides.

Being at Argo for 4 months these expectations are following:
 * Technical level: Lee's comments regarding engineering topics meet my high expectations. Even being manager he is able to get technical details at a good level in a short time and it's great to have a manager who can quickly grasp the core of the topic and provide meaningful feedback. Unfortunately my expectations regarding other team members were too high - Argo seems to be ""hardware-first"" company and from what I see it seems that indeed there are a lot of bright hardware people working in the company. It also seems ""software second"" where ""software"" is systems software and ML / AI things. So my personal impression is that at this point of time ""web services"" are on the third place (which makes total sense given current stage in company development: no web services are needed if there are no cars driving themselves).
 * Management level: this expectations are also met. It is important for me that I can raise problematic topics on 1:1s and see that these topics are taken in consideration. I also appreciate a lot level of independence Lee allows subordinates to have. However I can't say that my current team structure is comfortable to me: it's hard to not be able to rely on ""tech lead"" technical judgement and I feel that my skills are under-appreciated. This is ok for now but it might become a problem for me if situation will remain unchanged for 3-5 more months. 
 * Attitude towards people: I can't evaluate this area as of now. My personal approach is that I first provide value to the company to reach ""break-even"" point when value created by me balances out resources company spent bringing me and having me onboard. I don't feel I've reached that point yet. However as of now I'm feeling optimistic - I feel that I can raise concerning topics and these topics wouldn't be ignored.",,,Yan Babitski,ybabitski@argo.ai,Lee Morris,lmorris@argo.ai,Software,

Overwatch - created the overwatch team and launched the first overwatch product.

Triage Team - Took ownership of the Triage pipeline in Q1, also took on cloudit infrastructure to support viztool based triage tooling pipeline and deprecated the video based pipeline that existed. Unified engineering and tirage playback tooling

AWS / GCP evaluation negotiations - Lee engaged AWS and GCP directly to force them to compete for our business. This resulted in significant cost savings. One particular instance he was able to recoup tens of thousands of dollars from an expensive instance that was left running maliciously.

Mentorship - I originally hired yuhang wang before he transferred to Lee's team. Lee has done an excellent job mentoring yuhang on both communication and leadership. Yuhang has notably improved in both these areas since coming here and I have no doubt Lee's mentorship is a big driver of this change.

Ford - Lee has been the Software teams primary contact for many of the Ford engagements. His efforts have shielded most of the team from what can sometimes be costly distractions. This has allowed the entire software organization to develop our product faster.",,,Dave Schwanky,dschwanky@argo.ai,Lee Morris,lmorris@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,report,"I like Lee's management style. He focused on the big picture, entrusted me with tasks.

For example, while I was working on setting up the first version of cluster automation, even thought he is really experienced in that domain, he did not get into too much detail and dictate the implementation. 

The same applied to the terminal uploader tools, he make sure everything is going according schedule, but did not dictate the design/implementation. Provides me feedback, offer to help/provide me contract if I need.

On career development side, he also offered me executable advices on how to improve and advance my career.

2. Lee is very thoughtful and methodical with his team plans also. He produces team flow charts that show layout and also describe potential holes. 

3. Lee's task planning is just as careful as his team planning. He does a good job of matching the deliverables and task assignments to the specific team and their skill sets. This planning can be seen in his tech roadmaps and the team's design docs.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"What are some specific accomplishments, projects, and results that you drove during the review cycle timeframe?

Projects:

Ingest - Took ownership of ingest from IT and interns. Staffed the project, established a design/roadmap, delivered v0 and v1 versions of ingest. Since then we hardened ingest, landed event based filtering, added monitoring, and released the Homer status board. 

Parquet Pipeline - I built initial prototype in October. This infrastructure became the basis for the data pipeline for Analytics, Triage, Zeppelin, and Finder. Early on I was very hands on, but since then we formed the data core team to own this infrastructure. The team is actively working a roadmap to harden and optimize the pipeline. So far that has been no major outages impacting vehicle operations, but we can do better. This infrastructure was processing 6 PB/Mo in February and March timeframe.

Video Decompression - The team developed the video decompression pipeline in Q1 helping to unblock ingest. Yuhang Wang took point on this.

Finder - I built initial prototype for Finder in January. Since then we cost optimized and hardened the infrastructure. We are in a holding pattern until we can properly staff this work stream. Finder is a general tool to help brows for interesting logs. We have a lot of feedback on how to improve the tooling/platform, but we have been resource constrained to make significant progress beyond the initial prototype. Once this feedback is incorporated, the tooling will have much more value.

Analytics - Established a Luigi based framework for ETL of analytics data into Metabase. Took ownership of Metabase and hardened the platform. Performed several optimization tasks for specific boards, and changed how Metabase is deployed to compensate for Metabase stability issues. Several teams actively develop dashboards within this platform, but it could be radically improved. We are working on a roadmap for improvement starting in Q3.

Triage - Took ownership of Triage in February. Since then we retired the video pipeline and replaced with a workflow centered around Cloudit. We added some quick fix UI enhancements to improve to make the platform useable. The original version of the platform was vaporware, and did not satisfy the needs of Triage. The right approach is what we ended up doing, which was “do it, learn, and refactor”. This is starting to converge, but at the moment different teams own different aspects of the architecture. Once I took ownership of this platform I realized that we needed to integrate the Offboard team with the AV teams. The April Off-board visit to Pittsburgh was a first attempt at doing that. The teams were able to meet, and Off-Board been much more customer focused since then.

Jobs Platform - I developed V0 of the Jobs Platform targeting simulation as the first use case. Was able to scale simulation meet the OKR to reach 100k miles of simulation per week at the end of Q4. Since then I formed the Jobs Platform team and established a work-stream/roadmap. I also ensured that the team stayed focused their customers. Work-stream is very active and seems to be on track.

Overwatch - Worked with Ford to establish a strategy to provide a middle tier of services between AV Fleets and Ford TaaS, FCS, and other offboard systems. Formed a team to develop towards this vision. Established a relationship with Ford to execute jointly on developing the Go Ride/TaaS/OVDS/VDS infrastructure. The new team is quickly ramping up, and working with both Ford and the AV teams on how this will all function. The approach is to be iterative and establish nightly integration and regression tests.

Vendor Negotiation:

AWS - At this point we are close to a deal with AWS to save $2m+ for 2018/2019
* Reset expectations with AWS. Made sure the understood that they still had to win our business
* Source selected from Azure, AWS, GCP, and Ford IT down to AWS and GCP
* Lead a technical engagement in Q1 with GCP to validate if they are a viable solution - yes
* Projected 2018 usage estimates and had GCP and AWS compete for our business
* GCP came in $2m less with no extra agreement needed for the winfall
* AWS was really late in getting us final numbers
* Initially we were leaning towards GCP based on initial pricing estimates with both vendors
* Started discussions with the teams on the impact of a migration to GCP (Presentation could have been better)
* Internally we decided to stick with AWS to have no schedule risk for 2018
* I had a meeting with our AWS reps and their sales executive, and explained that I was recommending GCP. I had a fiduciary responsibility to Argo to recommend a vendor saving the company $2M. AWS took this seriously after I showed them the initial migration plan to GCP.
* AWS came back with an EDP agreement much closer to GCPs pricing
* We are still engaging with GCP to keep them in the running for next year

DataDog - Established a 3 month deal in December, based on adoption we are now working on a year long deal to save cost.

Others W/O deals - Looker, Tableau, Canonical, Nvidia Cloud, GCP, Hortonworks, Cloudera, MemSQL, Incredibuild, etc…

Budget:

Established Budget - the 2018 AWS budget, and actively tracking the billing for AWS. Didn’t have much to go on in October 2018 when we established the budget.

Cost Savings - Purchased Arista switches to reduce ingest cost by $70K/mo in the early months. The cost would have been much much higher in Feb/March.

Budget Ownership - I have not been able to own the budget for teams outside of my group. Instead I have been acting as a consultant and monitor. The monitoring tools are still in development.

Ford:
Weekly Sync - Established relationships with for IT and other groups within Ford. I also use this meeting to provide air-cover to relieve disruptions to the AV teams. This has born fruit and helped establish a joint vision between the two companies. At this point we need someone full-time to support this well.

Data Egress - Sent 200TB of data to Ford for their initial evaluation. The second and much smaller data dump will go out this week.

Vision - Was able to establish a vision of how Argo will build off-board systems with Ford for now and in the future. This vision has been adopted by Ford and is now the plan of record: Overwatch/OVDS

Deliverables - Delivered SDN Spec with data usage estimates (with help from systems). Delivered V0 API spec to start engagement with TaaS.

People:

Off-Board - Established 4 new teams: Data Core, DevOps, Jobs Platform, and Overwatch. Hired 8 people including an L6 who moved to the infra team. 

TPM - Helped with the hiring for SW TPMs and promoted Jason to his role

What are areas where you have grown and made improvements?

Where I have grown the most is in how to support AV development. I am far from an expert, but my understanding of AV and what it takes to scale the business has absolutely improved since day one:)

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,report,"Data group needs more formal documents and tools to enhance engineering excellence and reduce overhead caused by communication gaps. As the fast development and fast growth of usage of the infrastructures built by off-board team, human errors are unavoidably introduced without written documents or tools. There are headrooms for Lee to improve on prioritizing the readiness of written guidelines and internal tools with the fast growth of team. For example, off-board team should establish blameless post-mortem process and create post-mortem template. Since every functional team started on-tactical rotation, best practice sharing of handling user request and its regular refreshment is also important for Lee to prioritize. 

In order to best use every employee's potential, it is important for Lee to be patient and interactive when observing and evaluating every new member. When observing problems, increasing frequency of communication to understand background is usually more effective than making judgement without enough communication.  Lacking of communication usually leads to partially or totally incorrect judgement, and also results in the decrease of confidence and happiness of employee or other unnecessary side effects.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"During my short tenure with Argo, I have taken on many different tasks. 

Immigration
In the arena of immigration, I am considered the specialist. I have successfully organized the public access files to ensure compliance with the Department of Labor. I have also instructed Fragomen to email me all documents and forms that require signature instead of sending them via FedEx in order to save costs. Furthermore, I maintain and track the immigration status of all of Argo’s non-U.S. workers to ensure they have the appropriate visa status. In so doing, I lead the weekly Immigration meetings and provide direction to the Immigration team. 
I have also taken it upon myself to keep abreast of our non-U.S. workers international travel plans to ensure that their departure does not jeopardize their visa status/work authorization with Argo and that they have all necessary documentation to reenter the U.S. so that there are no delays to them returning to work.  I also presented Immigration issues to both the People Operations and Recruiting team in order to better educate them on the correct questions to ask when recruiting and onboarding non-U.S. workers. I am the go-to person for all immigration needs that our non-U.S. workers, Recruiters, and People Operations may have.
In order to assist with immigration, I identified a gap in the job ladders and hiring structure. I, in conjunction with Recruiting and People Ops, recognized that this is what is making the immigration process more time consuming and costly as we did not have uniform leveling processes and job title naming structure. I collated all resumes of Argo employees (over 300) to assess each employee’s position, job title, years of experience and education. I then created a job ladder that reflected our actual hiring process and the education requirements for each technical position. I then had recruiting and people operations review the research, received approval from senior management and assisted recruiting and people operations with rolling out the process. On the immigration front, this process has made it easier to assess and respond to USCIS audits (RFEs) by limiting the scope of information provided to external counsel to only relevant information and excluding “unicorn” hires.  Since RFEs are billed on an hourly basis, this will cut down on costs. 
I have further assisted People Operations with the onboarding process to ensure that they are capturing the correct documents for Form I-9/E-Verify as it relates to non-U.S. workers. This includes discussing the documents for our current workers as well as the documents required for interns. 

Records Retention
I am in charge of creating, managing and executing the Records Retention Policy for the Company. In so doing, I drafted the Records Retention policy, performed research to analyze the minimum requirements for record retention and worked hand-in-hand with the IT department to guarantee that the policy is executable.  We are presently in the process of incorporating NTSB guidelines into the policy to ensure that the Software Engineering records are captured accurately. Once these have been captured in the policy, I will then oversee the implementation of the policy. This will include presenting the policy to the Company to ensure they are saving records accurately to make the annual review go smoothly in January-March 2019. I also plan to oversee this review. 
Policy for Government and Public Inspection and Search Warrant Protocol
Along the same lines, I am in charge of creating, managing and executing the Policy for Government and Public Inspections and the Search Warrant Protocol. I performed the research to verify that the correct information and guidelines are included. I have also created slideshows for each policy to ensure that the people identified in the policy are informed of their role and able to respond accordingly. I am about to roll this out, if I have not done so by the time you read this review. 

Corporate Registrations
I have taken over all State, County, and City-level registrations from the Finance department. I have gathered all relevant documents in one location for easy access by pulling records at the state level and overseeing the move of the Corporate-Management drive to the Argo Legal drive. To help automate the annual filing process and guarantee no information is missing, I have overseen the onboarding of the outside vendor, CT Corp.  I have also taken the initiative to include permits and other licenses that are required for operation in each location thus making the spreadsheet all-inclusive of deadlines at all locations where the Company is located and/or registered. 

Software License Reviews
I am assisting Anya organizationally with Software License reviews. This involves maintaining the software license approval spreadsheets, folders and restructuring the organizational process. When I started the process was done on an ad-hoc basis. Since the All-Hands meeting when Bryan requested that all software go through the approval process, Anya and I discovered the process was lacking with such a high volume of requests. Therefore, we met with the IT department and have set up a ticketing system so that each request comes to both Legal and IT simultaneously and can be turned around more quickly. I also assist Anya with the actual review process. I pull licenses, send lengthier licenses to external counsel for review and monitor the timeliness of the response, and bring to Anya’s attention when software falls under certain licenses that are basically automatically approved to save her time. 

Legal Billing 
In the past month, I have started taking over the billing aspects of the Legal team. I am presently creating contacts at each law firm that Argo utilizes to receive timely invoices. 

Summary
Overall, I believe I am operating solidly at a Level 3, Legal Assistant II position with some overlap in the Level 4 position. Therefore, at this time, I am not requesting a promotion but look forward to taking on more responsibility.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Liesl came in to help the immigration team get a handle on all the everything involved in moving a person through the visa process and, subsequently, the green card process.  She brought with her a large body of knowledge for which we are truly grateful.  She organized our files, making sure they were complete and audit ready.  She created a spreadsheet that monitors the status of our employees, and she communicates effectively with Fragomen making sure they, and we, are on top of each candidates journey through the immigration process.

Liesl is always willing to answer my questions about the immigration process and explain things in a concise and articulate way.  If there's something she doesn't know offhand she will let us know that she'll get back to us after looking into it and she follows through with that.

Liesl has a good sense of humor, is willing to take on any task given her, and is thorough is everything she does.",,,Jeri McFadden,jmcfadden@argo.ai,Liesl Lopes,llopes@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Liesl has taken on a big task of organizing, creating and solidifying Argo's immigration policies and practices. Liesl is extremely knowledgable and has taken time to relay her knowledge to many teams. Recently, Liesl presented to the People Ops and Recruiting team on immigration expectations while recruiting and best practices. She took the time to breakdown the processes so everyone in the room was well informed and explained the laws and regulations. This presentation was quite informative to our recruiting team and set guidelines to accurately recruit and protect the company legally. 

Liesl has also taken charge on integrating into the onboarding process and assessing immigration needs. She has streamlined the process which has led to a smoother on boarding experience. Liesl and I also worked together to create a notification matrix to inform the onboarding team of any updates and immigration changes on candidates. Liesl has made the process for H1B transfers seamless resulting in employees having much sooner start dates. Liesl has also started to plan for the massive amount of employees who will be applying for permanent residency in 2018 - 2019. Liesl has great foresight into knowing what employee's immigration needs will be and plans accordingly. ",,,Mike Fitzpatrick,mfitzpatrick@argo.ai,Liesl Lopes,llopes@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Liesl has made a huge impact on the immigration and onboarding processes in such a short time.  I’d like to focus on how she:

Organized processes and procedures: Liesl was able to come in and quickly organize our public access files, employee immigration folders, and immigration tracker which helped us to quickly audit and address all needs.  She has a focused attention to detail and has helped to streamline the immigration process making the overall time involved much more efficient.

Prepare and become pro-active: Employers are finding a high percentage of visa transfers are receiving RFE’s and Liesl quickly put into place measures to ensure we are able to meet compliance needs and respond to RFE’s effectively minimizing last minute research and employee discomfort.  She coordinated with POps to gather and analyze our employees’ background information and more clearly define our job ladders and banding which allows Argo to better place individuals and build job descriptions based  experience, education, and skills.  

Created efficiency and cost savings: Her ability to organize process flow and utilize her wealth of knowledge and experience in immigration has helped us limit the back and forth with Fragomen as well as utilize other law firms to efficiently support employees.  Less back and forth on our end means less cost on legal fees.  Liesl’s ability to walk into an existing program and make improvements while managing incoming immigration needs is outstanding and the amount of time and coordination it takes to prioritize and make progress on these needs should not be taken lightly.  Liesl’s knowledgebase and advisement is also notably one of the best resources to guide managers in making thoughtful and impactful decisions as we support a large scope of immigration needs. 

She is an asset to the company and the Legal Team, and consistently provides excellent support and great attitude in answering questions and resolving issues when coordinating with POps, Recruiting, Managers, employees, and candidates.  Liesl is always pleasant to work with and a strong team player able to organize projects and communications.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Sense of urgency in her work.   At the time when Liesl started,  we had about thirty immigration cases in the fast-paced immigration pipeline.  To explain the demand for speed in Argo's immigration work before Liesl started, we had exactly 7 days and 10 hours to file immigration paperwork for Peter Carr in order to retain him as a highly-sought talent.  Peter had other offers pending, and Argo's swift immigration action brought him in.   Typically, this immigration case requires 8-10 days to execute.  Hence here at Argo, we can't afford making any mistakes or incurring delays in  immigration cases.  Liesl embraced this immigration challenge by quickly learning about all pending immigration cases, and pushing them forward, thus delivering timely labor supply to the organization.  Liesl has not missed a single deadline, and there is nothing, but praise from the stakeholders regarding her work ethics in processing immigration cases!

Cost Save to Argo.   Liesl also saved Argo a great deal in immigration costs.  In the process of filing immigration cases, we lacked organizational view of job ladders at Argo.   This omission made our outside counsel feel uneasy about immigration filings as our attorneys did not have a uniform view of the organizational hierarchy.    A lack of uniformity in immigration filings triggers costly immigration audits.    Liesl took upon herself the task of building a uniform vision of Argo technical hiring ladder. for immigration purposes.  Liesl harmonized all technical positions' education and experience requirements, thus building a uniform system for immigration filings.  This colossal task showed Liesl's ability to work on large segments of data and provide concise answers to complex problems.  Such tasks are usually done by involving outside counsel.  Liesl saved Argo thousands of dollars by performing this task inhouse.    Furthermore, Liesl saves Argo on legal costs by raising issues with attorneys about questionable Legal spends, and closely monitoring all costs.   Another great example of Liesl trimming costs for Argo is creation of a comprehensive system for immigration records.  Liesl contacted all law firms and pulled all their immigration files in the Argo repository so that Argo can keep track of any filings done for Argo.   Usually, requesting these filings from law firms incurs billable time and cost for Argo.  Liesl did massive pull, thus avoiding individual lookup charges.  Without these records, it is hard to ascertain the next step in the immigration process.  Prior to Liesl, I started immigration tracker for all the cases.  The tracker was a bit bare-boned.   Liesl fleshed out the structure and organization of the tracker and made it more user-friendly.    Multiple members of People Ops team who have access to the tracker commented on a pleasant way the tracker looks now.  

Strategy.  Liesl has a great strategic mind.  Prior to sending a case to the external counsel she always performs immigration research and syncs up with me to devise an immigration strategy.   This analysis of each cases before referring to the external counsel saves Argo fees on unnecessary legal consultations.   We now only send narrow inquiries to the attorneys to review and work on.  

Collaboration.  Liesl collaborates with others in a friendly and professional manner.  Argo's employees eagerly interact with Liesl on work-related assignments.

Desire to improve and grow.  Liesl asked to be allowed to grow in other areas.  Particularly, Liesl wants to learn software licensing approvals and IP.  I asked Liesl to deepen her knowledge in the software approvals by reading a book on software licencing.  Liesl quickly accomplished that.   As of now, Liesl shadows software licenses approvals, she spots and expedites non-complex reviews under my supervision.  Liesl is a great addition to the  Legal Team, and we all benefits Liesl's initiative, organizational skills and a go-getter attitude.",,,Anya Ryjkova,aryjkova@argo.ai,Liesl Lopes,llopes@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"Projects Where I Could Have Done Better: 
In the area of Records Retention, I did not anticipate the NTSB research for the software engineering team. I feel that I should have anticipated that. In the area of Immigration, I assisted one employee with their Adjustment of Status application only to realize that their priority date was rolled back during the drafting. I should have paid better attention to priority dates. I can definitely improve in the area of software license review. While I am catching most issues present in end-user license agreements, I do occasionally miss something important. 

Areas Where I Can Grow and Improve:
I am very interested in intellectual property law and would be happy to assist Anya and Jason in this area. In the area of Export Controls, I would be happy to learn more about this if there is a need.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Communication with employees is one area where Liesl could improve.

Liesl does a great job of reaching out to employees and getting them started on the immigration process, answering questions, gathering documentation, etc, then working with Fragomen on their individual cases .  An area of improvement could be anticipating the fears and motives of the employees going through the process and digging into why they want their start delayed or why they want filed a certain way.  This would enable the employee to be brought on earlier and would alleviate the fear they have in changing employers or being red flagged and getting an RFE.

I'm not sure what Liesl's plans for continuing education are, but this is also an area where she might be able to grow, whether it's an immigration certificate or going through the paralegal process, this would add a layer to Liesl's experience and knowledge base.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,report,"Lillian has been a terrific manager and colleague. She’s been results-driven with the projects we have worked on together. She’s deadline oriented and thinks holistically about the process. As my manager, she’s helped me develop my skills in order to perform my job more effectively. She’s a great listener and has had key insights into how to be more efficient and effective in my role. 

An example of a long-term project Lilli and I have worked on together that illustrates many of her strengths as a manager and colleague was the implementation of Celigo. While working on this project with her, she was able to troubleshoot IT issues, pull teams together to complete tasks, gather data, and was available to assist with any issues or problems that arose.  

For example, we ran into issues logging into Celigo due to expired login credentials. Lili recognized the problem and pulled the IT department in to help reactivate the credentials. This allowed us to get started working on the project and move to the next step. In another instance, Lilli helped coordinate between People Ops and Finance to make sure that we had accurate and appropriate information that we needed in order to complete the field mappings that were critical for the project. Even with Lili’s busy schedule she was available for our scheduled calls and meetings and answered questions along the way. Lilli’s persistence and expertise allowed us to successfully implement Celigo, which has increased our productivity and efficiency in regards to data entry and integrity.


Lilli has many traits of a good manager. She’s an educator, good listener, and effective communicator.  She’s taught me tasks and programs that have made me more effective and efficient in my role. With my increasing workload, she’s helped me brainstorm creative solutions that will enable me to allocate my time more effectively in order to reduce a month-end bottleneck.

During our weekly meetings Lilli is always available to listen, provide relevant information pertaining to my job, and to help come up with solutions to problems or areas I am working on. She helps me define my goals and strategize on how to achieve them. 

Lilli values effective communication. When our team has information that needs to be communicated company wide, she is very considerate to deliver the information in a timely, clear, and concise manner. 

Working with Lilli has been a great. Her warm welcome to Argo has been appreciated from the start, and I appreciate her sharp wit and sense of humor.

For 2 of the most recent projects we were working on to correct taxes for any affected employees on work visas and for the setup of domestic partner imputed income, I needed accurate tax advice to provide to ADP.  Lilli reached out to our third-party advisers to get the confirmation we needed on how to set up the taxation and I was able to initiate the proper setup and proceed with the necessary corrections.  She genuinely wants me to succeed at my role with the ultimate goal of having regular payrolls process without a glitch.  We regularly meet with the People Ops team to coordinate any items that affect payroll & human resources.  Lilli is always available to our team for assistance and has created documents with procedures specific to one's role in the process.  We have discussed ways that I could utilize the professional development reimbursement that Argo provides on an annual basis.  She has provided valuable feedback & constructive criticism improving my performance and also acknowledged all of the accomplishments I have achieved so far.  In the short 10 weeks that I have worked at Argo, Lilli has demonstrated exceptional knowledge in the areas of payroll, finance, expenses, and taxes and is continually initiating process improvements to produce a cohesive team.",,,Janell Dresel,jdresel@argo.ai,Lilli Cannon,lcannon@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Lilli and I have been able to work closely together since November as it relates to certain areas of Argo’s accounting.  For the accounting and finance team, a huge portion of Q1’2018 was related to successfully completing our first audit.  Since Lilli was one of the first accounting and finance team members, I had to flow certain audit requests to her and ask her for supporting documentation for transactions that were made in early 2017.  Lilli was always able to locate the support timely, and provide explanations to the auditors, which helped to eliminate follow-up questions and further selection testing from the PwC team.  She was also able to provide items on our request like the Payroll narrative and payroll year-end reconciliation in a timely manner, which was important for completing the audit on time within a tight timeframe.
Another huge push in early 2018 has been to cross-walk the Ford FMs with Argo’s policies and procedures.  This has been a time-consuming effort, and Lilli has reviewed over 30 Ford policies and made determinations as to whether or not they were applicable to Argo and to what extent.  This has also involved creating policies and procedures which Argo did not previously have.  These will be crucial as we continue to grow and look to implement SOX controls.
Lilli and I also work together on payments.  As I determine what needs to be paid, I send requests to Lilli to initiate certain wires or ACHs to vendors, and Lilli does so in a timely manner so that they can be approved by the Director of Finance or the CFO before the close of business that day.
Lilli also continues to remain involved in the Accounting and Finance month-end close process by completing payroll related reconciliations.  We have tightened our close process to a 3-day Argo close, and Lilli is able to complete her closing checklists items within the time constraints.  As we review on day 4, Lilli and Janel are able to help answer any payroll related flux questions.  Lilli was also instrumental in adding a payroll associate to our team.  With increased ADP invoices coming in related to the payroll process, it is evident that more reconciliations are being made and items are being identified that may not have been previously thanks to the increased support and Lilli’s diligence.
Lilli continues to be a positive impact on the accounting and finance team, and it is a pleasure to have her as a teammate.",,,Emily Ruscetti,eruscetti@argo.ai,Lilli Cannon,lcannon@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Lilli has had a lot on her plate from well before my on-boarding and continues to juggle a high volume of tasks currently that directly and positively impact the company as well as the employees on a daily basis. 

I was extremely impressed upon my arrival at Argo in October 2017 that Lilli was performing the majority of the payroll tasks on her own for such a high volume headcount and one that was constantly growing. The payroll function in a steady environment is complicated and requires an intensely detailed oversight to comply with IRS regulations and provide seamless compensation to employees so it speaks volumes that she was able to maintain the process and now oversee it for such an ever-changing company. An absolute validation of her effort in this process was the fact that during the 2017 financial statement audit performed by PwC there were no adjustments found as a result of their detailed testing of payroll. It's also very important during the audit that requests are met with urgency and professionalism. Multiple times Lilli was required to meet with the audit team to provide descriptions of the payroll process and the auditors always walked away from the meetings with a clear picture of what our internal processes are to better enable them to perform their testing.

Lilli consistently promotes a positive, fun, and productive work environment among the team. She is not shy about passing along praise she's heard in meetings for work that was done by others which gives the individual and thereby the team a boost when needed most. She is a diligent worker capable of stepping in to help in multiple areas which provides a great example for those around her and those who report to her. 

Overall, she's a great asset to the Finance team and Argo as a whole, and has accomplished so much in a very short amount of time.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"**Notable Contributions and Organizational Impact**

Since my last performance review in the beginning of November 2017, I have accomplished the following major initiatives:

**Compensation Management Implementation**
Much of my time during and prior to this period was spent working with the Recruiting Program Manager, Kyle Neff, to backfill the management holes in People Ops, which had several distinct areas of need.  However, a centerpiece two-month project that I assumed was implementing the Compensation Management software to review 180 people in ADP on a very short timeline.  

The implementation process required two separate phases: one for salary changes, and one for year-end bonuses. First, we had to configure level-banding within ADP.  Then, we had to use Lattice performance scores, hire dates and salary data to create a spreadsheet that gave formulaic salary and bonus recommendations.

We then created the ‘bonus event’ and ‘salary event’ in ADP, applied the budget dictated by management, and rolled out the results to the managers for review and approval.  At the end of the recommendation period, I produced automated yet customized letters to communicate the compensation decisions to each employee.  The process went smoothly and the results were timely, accurate and widely accepted as equitable.  This was due, in part, to the diligence demonstrated by our process and the insight I was able to provide from my experience and subjective judgment.

Throughout the process, I consulted with Bryan, Pete and Matt on a regular basis as needed to garner their input and approval, and I also made my own suggestions to fine-tune the results.  I added value to the process using my subjective judgment and knowledge of individual contributions and accomplishments within the G&A team and with other members of the organization.

**Marked Increase in People Ops Responsibilities**
During the compensation event project, we identified employees whose salaries did not fit within the pay grade banding.  We communicated suggestions to management for correction, and these suggestions continue to be implemented today.  The process of evaluation and assessment required to rectify salary levels across the organization, combined with quality issues due to the previous management, brought me necessarily deeper into the POps domain.

I took on a greater role within the department, including advising and managing the People Ops coordinators Mike Fitzpatrick and Briana Mitcheson on a daily basis.  I managed them and the former PLI office manager Lori Zirkel in onboarding all PLI employees to the Argo payroll system months earlier than expected.  I also managed the completion of year-end HR compliance items such as the the EEOC report with their support.  In order to do this, I consulted with outside counsel and then instructed the People Ops Coordinator Briana Mitcheson and HRIS and Compliance Analyst Maria Beshalske in coding each employee appropriately.  I also began the ACA reporting process, including configuring necessary base data in ADP, and then I worked with the new People Ops Manager Jen Honick to implement it.

**Payroll Department**
Since assuming payroll responsibilities from the CFO when I joined the company over a year ago, I have been the sole person responsible for performing all payroll functions, which collectively have evolved into a lengthy and complex task area given the constant growth of the company, which has created multiple tax jurisdictions and unique personal situations and exceptions that must be accommodated.

By the fall of last year, payroll and related HRIS functions had become unmanageable for one person.  As I was the only one who set up new employees in payroll, I trained People Ops coordinator Briana Mitcheson in how to enter new hires and continue to manage her in doing so.  I set up a spreadsheet based workflow process to track and audit her work, which allowed me to monitor her development in the role and further train her.  I continue using this tool to supervise the work of Maria Beshalske, who took over new hire entry from Briana, and also to manage the new Payroll Associate Janell Dresel.

**Proactive Annual Audit and Payroll Tax Maintenance**
After a year of rapid growth, transitions of systems and general related issues, I thought it prudent to engage BDO to audit payroll taxes before year-end.  They discovered a handful of issues related to payroll data entry that would have affected employees’ tax returns, which I corrected during the year-end break and was able to amend completely before the EOY and Q1 filing deadlines. As a result of this audit, I implemented necessary workflow and policy changes with the People Ops team and created a new data entry process with checks to prevent future errors.  I created a payroll tax tracker that checks each payroll tax against three sources, which I use to catch errors in a timely manner.  The net result was that no employee had tax errors resulting from company or vendor errors and all annual filings and withholdings were correct or corrected by year’s end.

BDO also confirmed my suspicion that there were minor errors in coding and calculation of local withholding and employer taxes that resulted from a failure in the way ADP handles jurisdictions of similar or the same names in PA.  So, I researched and clarified the errors, led the People Ops Coordinator and Compliance Analyst in re-coding the employees correctly, and then I calculated and re-filed the 2017 payroll expense tax returns to reflect the adjusted numbers.  All calculations were made, re-filed and paid prior to the filing deadlines.  Lastly, we established the source of confusion that had created most of the problems and established processes to guard against and check for those errors in the future.

In preparing for year-end, I understood and prepared for issues having to do with having had two payroll systems and two insurance companies during fiscal year 2017.  Summarily, the problem was that the standard reporting and calculations did not account for both systems and therefore showed the wrong totals, for example, in reporting of cafe 125 amounts on the W-2s.  I worked with the People Ops Coordinator Briana Mitcheson to gather the correct information and calculate and upload the corrected data during the winter break.  The result was that all W-2 amounts were prepared correctly and in time for distribution to the employees despite a very challenging year of growth and systems development.

Lastly, as part of my management of general payments, and my crossover work into People Ops, I created an ADP open case tracking sheet for both POps and Finance to use to manage all our open payroll and HRIS issues. 

**Payroll Associate**
As I was the only person running payroll for a company of 200+ people, it became critical to hire an additional payroll person for redundancy and simple departmental capacity.  To accomplish this, I wrote the job description and screened and interviewed candidates for the role, prioritizing intimate knowledge of ADP as well as experience with multi-jurisdiction technology/engineering companies.  I was pleased to hire Janell Dresel, a former ADP representative who was responsible for payroll for many client companies, and who also worked in private industry.  She began in March and plugged right into Argo, immediately helping to relieve the burden of what has become a very complex payroll process.  With her experience, she has since helped to make improvements to the payroll process, to compress the processing time down to require only three days of advance notice, and helped institute more audit checks to the People Ops data entry for purposes of quality control.

With additional resources to manage payroll, I have recently been able to tackle several open issues: 1) domestic partnership insurance imputed income and related deductions, 2) payroll taxation of visa holders, and 3) methods for quality control in managing employees’ local tax withholdings.  These continual self-audit and correction systems are already in use and will be completed in the second quarter.  The ultimate goal is to get to zero post-quarter amendments of any kind, which I believe we will be able to achieve by Q3 of this year.

**Policy & Procedure**
I have worked to help review and develop Argo Policy & Procedure, reading 30 Ford finance manuals and completely authoring several policies, including payroll, timekeeping and treasury related to my functional area.  I will continue to help in the review process and am able to add value with regard to compliance and proper levels of P&P in the organization generally.  I have a great knack for developing sound P&P and reviewing and editing the work of others.


**401(K)**
In January, I worked extensively with the Finance Program Manager, Isobel King, the CFO, Dan Beaven, and the vendors ADP, Vanguard and Ascensus to implement the new 401(K).  This involved updating the ADP software to calculate but not deduct from our bank account, updating employee deductions in payroll, and developing a new spreadsheet and process for verifying employee and employer contributions and uploading them to Vanguard.  As employees cannot update their 401(K) in the ADP portal anymore, I also had to create a new system for People Ops to enroll new hires in Vanguard and update the census (under my supervision.)  I also worked with Isobel to update employee-facing communications and troubleshoot implementation problems.

While implementing the new mega backdoor Roth deferral type, I helped to discover and plan for two open issues: 1) Vanguard had not fully and properly activated all of the necessary options to allow employees to make in-service distributions to effect the mega backdoor, and 2) understanding that these contributions could make us fail year-end compliance testing (as expected), and how to measure for and account for that.  I am currently working with the FP&A Manager, Jen DeBrincat, to forecast the amount of employer contributions necessary to ensure that Argo can overcome the testing shortfall.  And, equally as important, allow the Accounting department to accrue for the liability to do that.  I have also worked with Vanguard and Dan Beaven to amend the plan to allow for the necessary in-service distributions.

At the same time as helping to implement the Argo 401(K), I began the process of closing the PLI 401(K), which had necessarily become defunct with the end of their separate payroll on 12/31/17.  I worked with Lori Zirkel to complete all necessary paperwork to merge the PLI plan into the Argo plan, and in doing so, discovered that a significant chunk of the PLI assets were in a fund that would prevent us from liquidating it altogether, and require us to keep the plan open for another year, at our expense.  I researched the issue and worked with both Vanguard and our investment advisor Mark Rychel to come up with a solution that would allow us to liquidate the plan and close it now.  I then directed Lori Zirkel in implementing the idea with ADP, including communicating to the affected employees the steps required, completing the necessary paperwork, and monitoring the conversion.  The liquidation is in process now, with target completion at the end of May.

**Workers’ Compensation Insurance**
I worked with Isobel to change our workers’ comp carrier.  This involved meeting with the state auditor to explain our operations and employee roles, and continued with re-coding all employees to comply with the results of our audit.  We also had to create a system to more accurately forecast this cost and the accruals necessary to ‘smooth’ the cost projection over the year proportional to the payroll forecast.

**Labor Allocation**
I worked with the CFO, Dan Beaven, to develop a labor allocation model that would calculate labor costs against our project codes.  I have created a maintainable and reliable system of spreadsheets that calculates all labor costs by team against the live list of project codes.  I am currently fine-tuning it to also calculate the labor costs of legacy PLI sales in conjunction with the VP of LiDAR, Mark Itzler.  This system will enable Argo to properly allocate labor to justify and substantiate R&D tax credits, accrue the cost of internally developed software and eventually account for maintenance separately from development.

**Accounting**
I have all this time continued my duties reconciling payroll and labor costs, including maintaining and regularly updating the payroll reconciliation spreadsheet to automatically account for all payroll costs without hand-calculation.  I have also created repeatable journal entries in Netsuite to efficiently make these journal entries concurrently with payroll, reducing the amount of labor and time required to close the books each month.  I have worked closely with the Senior Accountant, Andrew Mulford, to systematically capture out-of-period tax adjustments in the payroll entries, and to develop policy on payroll accruals.  Very importantly, I am familiar with the close process, A/P and much of the accounting that happens each month, and am able to add value or provide relief in many cases when the rest of the team needs assistance.

**Treasury**
I have all this time continued my treasury duties, monitoring the bank account daily, as well as initiating all electronic payments.  I have been working with PNC, the Director of Finance, and Procurement to institute an all-electronic payment program, and am currently working to increase our credit card rebate.  I am reviewing now with the CFO additional steps we can take to ensure controls and reinforce separation of duties that are more scale-appropriate as we grow.

**Expense Reporting**
I continued to manage Jenna Goldby in her expense report and P-card program administration, including providing support to implement the new Expense Pay bank interface, advising her on possible ways to streamline the expense approval process, and implementing employee taxable benefit connections to payroll.  I am happy to be managing her regularly as the interface between Concur and payroll makes this functional and comfortable for both of us.

**Data Mapping and Systems of Record**
I directed Jenna Goldby in implementing the Celigo connector between ADP and NS, which required mapping data fields between different systems of record using an FTP connection, and creating a spreadsheet to audit the data before upload.  I am also participating in a seminal project with Isobel to inventory all data and systems of record across the G&A teams as directed by the CFO.  I have great skill in formulating logical workflows and processes in this regard and am happy to be involved in improving our systems and making our processes failsafe.

**Corporate**
I worked with the General Counsel, Kate Kozlowski, the Director of Finance, Ming Su, and external counsel to register to do business in New Jersey when we brought the PLI employees onto our payroll.  This was not as simple a process as it can be in other states, and required great coordination and effort to get the necessary withholding tax identification numbers.

I also mentored the new Paralegal, Liesl Lopes, in filing for new corporate jurisdictions and maintaining foreign LLC required annual filings.  She continues to use me a resource to find whatever data she needs to maintain our corporate status in every jurisdiction.

**New Hire Onboarding**
I worked with the People Ops Coordinator, Mike Fitzpatrick, to formalize the Finance portion of new hire onboarding.  I worked with Mike to create a slideshow for new hires, and I meet with every new hire to orient them to payroll, 401(K) and expense reporting. 

**Teamwork**
In order to effectively coordinate work across the organization, I regularly work with the Legal, People Ops, and Procurement teams.  I often mediate between various people or departments and do my best to subtly resolve or prevent conflict, and generally contribute to company harmony.

**Communication, Teamwork and Leadership**
Throughout the above section are numerous examples of communication, leadership and teamwork.  Throughout the past year, and even more so with the departure of the prior people operations leadership, I have made deliberate and significant efforts to gain confidence and ability as a manager and leader, and have been pleased to find that my authority and point of view are respected by my manager, peers and subordinates.  I believe my position at Argo has allowed my to grow considerably as a professional, as I have been granted recognition and challenges commensurate with my efforts.  And, this has been truly humbling, rewarding and enriching for me.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Lilli has been an immense resource of support and guidance throughout the leadership changes within People Operations and continues to remain a knowledge powerhouse and supporter of People Operations functions.

Lilli managed several major projects in coordination with People Operations:

Compensation Management - with a lack in POps leadership and band-with during and following the year end performance reviews,  Lilli was able to pull together information with the support of Kyle Neff and find an efficient way to generate individualized documents on a mass scale.  What they accomplished in such a short amount of time was incredibly impressive and truly speaks to Lilli’s ingenuity.  Throughout the process, Lilli helped to identify and further support compensation and leveling outliers so that managers had time to address these issues with employees.  

ADP build up - Prior to having Maria on our team, Lilli was my go to for ADP knowledge and support.  She built out and identified processes and reporting including high impact projects such as the EEOC report, ACA reporting, and building out the base templates utilized for on-boarding and payroll. Lilli was able to coordinate with ADP and oftentimes individually find solutions for our needs within ADP as an HRIS system including how to onboard PLI employees and migrate them onto our Payroll.  Her understanding of both Payroll and HR needs helped the POps to confirm with Argo Leadership ADP’s capabilities and establish guidelines for on-boarding, off-boarding, and job change procedures. 

Following the finalization of the 401 K rollover, I’ve started to support the finance team regarding 401 K and it’s clear the amount of work Lilli put into defining out processes, procedures, and reporting to ensure employee elections and data flow smoothly from Argo to Vanguard.  In any project you coordinate on with Lilli much as with this, she already had a clear cut role identification document so my involvement in the weekly 401 K reporting needs was clear and I was easily able to find information and support employees. 

In POp’s time of need we often heard excuses from other departments about limited band-with and capability, but Lilli stepped up and stepped in actively looking for ways to support Kyle, Mike, and I while she already had large workload.  When I call her a knowledge powerhouse this is no way limited to Payroll and her advisement on human resource related matters as well as process and project management was (and still is) impressive.  I regard her as a mentor and admire that she continuously shares what she’s learned and how she's discovered ways of improving things.  Lilli is someone who will always find a more efficient way of doing things and the experience she’s built in her journey to fill this need is also invaluable - where it would take others a significantly greater period of time to come to the same solution, Lilli is readily able to provide one.   Two recent examples come to mind: 1.) in generating confirmation statements for the entire employee base quickly from a spreadsheet and 2.) how to manipulate ADP's limited data for an FML UNUM report.  

She's managed a huge workload with a large scope and has always managed to prioritize her work and stay on top of all needs.  While I cannot speak to all of the projects Lilli has touched, it is clear she has a solid understanding of Operations and is capable of positively impacting multiple areas within the company and I'm thankful for all of the support she provides to myself and to People Operations.

I would like to gain a broader and more in-depth knowledge of 401(K) law to better manage 401(K) administration with regard to such things as: employee tax deadlines, limits and the mechanics of the MEGA backdoor etc.  I would also like to understand the investments themselves and how the mechanics of investment decisions are carried out.  I would also like to explore alternatives to Vanguard/Ascensus.

**Proactive Coordination**

I would like to increase the frequency of regular meetings with other teams to keep on top of potential issues that affect Finance.  This is especially important with the Procurement and People Ops teams.  Having more advanced knowledge of what is coming down the pike would go a long way in heading off problems before they start.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"I've worked at Argo for 3.5 months during this review period, major accomplishments include:
1. onboarding process, got familiar with the Argo codebase and development environment; design of the stereo pipeline; colleagues and the big picture
2. analyzed and converted primal dual surface regularization solver to c++
3. ported image processing utilities to gpu, including resampler, rectifier, grayscale, sobel and census
4. created and extended stereo imaging tasks, stereo pipeline porting and testing in process

Overall it's been a smooth and rewarding start, I feel my involvement and efficiency is increasing everyday, plan has been laid out and there is plenty to explore and to work on.  It feels great to be able to apply my past experience to this job and contribute to the team.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,manager,"Lenny is rapidly turning into a excellent performer in the organization and I think that once he has been fully immersed in Argo practices and they have become second nature, he will expand his contributions beyond the Special Projects team. I think Lenny will soon be contributing to other aspects of the GPU pipeline, and we have already seen how his diligence has led to the discovery of bugs (debayering) and highlighting of issues (proper infrastructure for multithreading). His onboarding time was as expected: we don't have great documentation and it is painful to go through. His first contributions reflected that: early PRs needed significant reworking. But again, that is inline with my expectations. More recently, his contributions have been significantly stronger and he continues grow in his knowledge of Argo practices and thereby increase the pace of his contributions.  Lenny is responsible for stereo pipeline and has been methodically working through each stage. He asks questions when needed and sticks to his tasks. If I were able to split my rating, it would be 2 for the first 2/3 of his time at Argo and 3 for the last 1/3.",,,Michael Happold,mhappold@argo.ai,Lingyuan Wang,lwang@argo.ai,Software,

I enjoy working with him and when I hand him a piece of prototyping code, I know I can trust him to turn that into clean and efficient massively parallel realtime production code. So far he has ported most of our CPU stereo pipeline into GPU and while creating new code, he also helped fixing existing CUDA code. He has found a very obscure debayering bug in our image library which has being lying there for months.

3. mostly worked within the team, but need to get more involved with what's happening in other related team work, such as infrastructure, calibration and detection.

Robotic systems are extremely complex, and the interactions between components can produce surprising results. It may not be that he discovers bugs in his own code, but issues in the code of others as his software takes resources that were otherwise available or as he interfaces with cameras rather than logs. The other areas Lenny has already identified himself:  improve the modularity of his code, increase his understanding of Argo practices, and dig into the algorithms he is implementing. Learning the algorithms will enable him to provide insights on better ways to optimize them.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Lisa has been a excellent addition to our VehOps team.

She is a hard worker and the epitome of a team player. She has consistently come in early and stayed late to support VTR's, update/create/ learn training material, or even help to coach VO's on certain things that they felt they weren't grasping or understanding the way that they should have, or the way that they felt their peers were.  I have seen Lisa give several lessons on the vehicle and using Argonaut.  Many operators have said this was beneficial to them - because although they had seen the GUI for awhile, her walk-through of it gave them a better understanding of how it could be used, and also prompted more questions to be answered.  This ties back in to us always having knowledgeable operators.  She has also been an instrumental part to training the operators to a high standard.  A great example of this is the Enhanced Driving training that our VO's must complete.  She designed and implemented a comprehensive driver training course meant to assess and sharpen the various skills spread across situational driving as well as general ""best practices.""

Lisa was part of the push for 3,500 auto miles at the end of Q4.  She was a key piece to our team being able to achieve this.  With so few AV certified drivers at the time, it was crucial to have all hands on deck to be able to get to our goal.  She had not been with us long, but had no issues essentially ""jumping"" into the action.  She was also part of a presentation that Women of Argo had put together.  This was done at Seneca Valley High School and primarily pertained to women working in fields that are largely consumed by males.  I thought this was a great representation of not only the caliber of person Lisa is, but employee as well.

She's been a great resource, mentor, and example for the Operators - as well as myself and other leads.  She keeps us apprised of certain notions that may be floating amongst the operators, as well as potential confusion on policy, procedures, or just general questions that she happens to be fielding on a more regular basis.  This has allowed us to have better insight to what the operators are thinking at times - thus making it easier to address or plan to address any questions/issues as necessary.  She's also been able to solve some other smaller issues before they were able to become a larger issue.  One of our operators was needing to use his peers' phone to be able to Fleetio a vehicle.  She was able to request and receive a tablet from IT to keep on hand for this Operator and any others with the same need, to be able to still perform the functions of their job without needing to burden their peers.

Lisa really embodies what it means to be a good team member, role model, and great leader.  I am excited to have her on our team!",,,Anuruk Buranathanit,aburanathanit@argo.ai,Lisa Fischer,lfischer@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"You have done a great job of setting up and administering the Enhanced Driving training at New Stanton - great course layout that focuses on the important core concepts, good job in tracking times and completions, as well as laying out needs for the coming class.  Everyone enjoys this portion and it also is a great team-building exercise as well when everyone starts to get competitive.  Lots of great talking points demonstrated here from what I've seen and heard from your trainees.  If we identify trends later on, think of ways to modify the course to address these problem areas.

Tracking progress to Phase 3 completion has been a huge help for me - you did a great job in setting up the tracker with the necessary information and make sure it's always accurate and a good source of truth to a trainees' current state of certification.  Keep up the awesome job here and think of ways to continue improving and tracking more trends so we can hone in on potential issues before they become a bigger problem.  Your flexibility and adaptability to schedule Phase 3 exams and observations has been crucial to getting safe, confident VOs on the public roads in a quick and efficient manner.

You have built a great rapport with the VO team and are a constant open ear for any feedback that the rest of the team may not be aware of - you spot needs early by observation, and go the extra mile in asking for more in-depth feedback from our VOs to see what we can and should be doing better.  This is very important in keeping them engaged and maintaining the culture that we've built up over a short timeframe.

You have been the go-to for interviews practically every week, and you do a good job of allocating that time and managing it so that you're not rushed and can give each candidate an equal amount of time.  We have gotten lots of great drivers into our program due to your feedback and recommendations, and I think you've kept the standard very high in this regard - great that you also believe your questions can get better, keep on improving!

",,,Steven Swartz,sswartz@argo.ai,Lisa Fischer,lfischer@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Accomplishments:

1. When I started in December we had no AV certified VO's (only a handful of Senior VO's) I have helped move the process forward doing everything necessary to help train and certify fifty Vehicle Operators and four leads for Dearborn, Miami and Pittsburgh. This accomplishment was a team effort but I am proud to say I came in early and stayed late to make sure everything was completed including the paperwork. I also pride myself on perfect attendance since my hire date, even when I was under the weather I came to work and pushed myself to get things done. This is a very important accomplishment because making sure we have many certified VO's means we can complete VTR's, push toward hitting mileage goals and get high utilization which is all very important in making sure ARGO is a success.

2. Enhanced Driving Course
I was honored when Brandon asked me to design a training course to cover several important aspects of driving skills. 

My course includes the requested criteria and more:
30 mph emergency lane change 
ABS braking
Forward spatial awareness
Reverse spatial awareness
Properly backing vehicle into parking space
Properly following detailed instructions
Use of mirrors - No back-up camera
Each trainee gets 3 timed passes - This allows for a way to gauge improvements and gives me 
the ability to understand areas that need coaching.

Established a setup and tear-down process which allows anyone to setup the same course.
Utilized a portion of the track which allows other testing/training in progress at the same time.
Created a detailed evaluation form in google forms for good documentation of trainee progress.

My biggest accomplishment with this driving course was experiencing trainees showing amazing improvements after coaching and watching the trainees leaving the course with more confidence and skills behind the wheel.

3. #Hashtag - Formatted and laminated a easy to read hashtag resource for each car.
My takeaway and accomplishment with this project was that I realized a need and stepped up to make a resource to help everyone have a better understanding of the #hashtag options.

4. Women of Argo asked me to participate in a presentation at Seneca Valley High School
This presentation was focused on young women pursuing careers in mostly male dominated fields. I talked about my experiences in a mostly male dominated hobby (motorsports) and we talked about Argo and women in engineering and technology.
My biggest accomplishment with this experience was meeting and experiencing a group of young amazing intelligent women and seeing them excited about our technology and also working with other Argo women who work in the Engineering field which allowed me to learn more about another Argo team.

5. Signed up and completed my Argo interview training & shadowing procedures. My focus is the driving interview/evaluation portion. This gave me the opportunity to help build the VO team but also gave me the ability to learn and gain new skills as I shadowed experienced interviewers. I take this opportunity very serious, I created a route that allows many driving tasks to be evaluated and stays within the time limits of each candidate. I take notes on each candidate and stay on schedule to move the process forward. My biggest takeaway with this process is the ability to learn new skills and watch the VO team grow with quality team members.

6. Created a training progress and tracking spreadsheet.
This spreadsheet helped me stay organized and on point with the process and tasks that needed completed. I hope this spreadsheet can help others to easily see what has been completed and what may need done. 

7. Updated VO exam with better questions to correlate with current training process
As I receive the completed exams I utilize this information to tweak my training, making sure I cover all material. I check which questions VO's struggle with and make sure I discuss this information with the VO. My takeaway with this project was the opportunity to work with Brandon and learn what information and details were important as we move the training forward and grow.

8. I make good effort to get to the depot early and I stay late. The reason I see this as an accomplishment is I am trying to set a standard and good example. Me being in the depot before the VO's arrive and not leaving until they are gone shows good work ethic and a good way to lead by example and gain respect. This also gives me time to get caught up with all training evaluations and paperwork which is important to stay on top of. 

9. When I started in December, I jumped in a car and got 100 auto miles under my belt and I was part of a team that hit the 3,500 mile goal before the end of 2017.
This is an accomplishment because I did what ever it took to help my team hit goals. I am a team player. As January February and March rolled by and we only had a few Senior AV certified operators I stayed late to do VTR's and testing on a regular basis.

10. I make great effort to ask and listen to VO's feedback
A few examples: I found out Mason and Susan were vegetarians, I requested some vegetarian lunches, I found out Justin was using other VO's cell phones, I requested a tablet for anyone who can't use personal phones for Fleetio. I found out VO's would love to have the option to eat lunch outside when the weather is nice, I requested a (non-smoking )picnic table outside the depot. My takeaway from these efforts is seeing such a great team already working very hard and seeing small improvements making things even better.  

11. I worked with Mike and Joe to make sure Fleetio was in the exact procedure order of the training process for startup which helps make the process easier more efficient and consistent. Joe has handed me the responsibility to make sure the VO section is always in the correct order as the training process for pre-shift, post shift and seat swaps. 

12. Just a few examples of how I demonstrate some of our Core Values:
Safety First:
  I implemented and enforce windows down in depot for safety.
  I observe the fleet and caught the back-up camera being used at inappropriate times.
Deliver Compelling Experiences:
  I was honored to be the Operator for the filming of Nova.
  I was honored to be a part of the Wall Street Journal presentation.
Be Good:
 I always give 100+% 
Be Humble:
 I lead by example with a positive encouraging attitude.
Be Open Minded & Pragmatic:
 I listen to everyone with an open mind and put myself in the shoes of others to give me the 
 perspective of others.  
Encourage Teamwork:
 My Enhanced Driver Training is done with groups and I encourage everyone to support each 
 other even in times of competitiveness.  

13. I am in the process of learning from Steve the FIT process of the training. I come in early and stay late to make sure I am understanding the process from before the trainees start to after they leave for the day. I am shadowing Steve and helping Steve with the class as I learn.

14. I always take time to study release notes and understand the mandatory takeovers, this information is critical when doing public road evaluations. 

15. I take my job (career) serious and am proud to be a part of ARGO. I respect my team and would help my team with anything necessary to move ARGO to be the Best in the Industry! I also support all of our contractor VO's and respect them and want them to be happy and successful VO's. I will always be a ARGO voice for them. T-Shirts??

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"I admire Steve and his ability to communicate with such confidence. I understand why he is that way and it is because he takes time to keep learning. He prides himself on being able to answer any question. I know I can do a better job with my confidence and communication skills. But it starts with me taking the time to learn more. I have set some goals for myself to take time to learn more about Self Driving Technology, which will give me more confidence. 

I like to talk about my passion (my cars) and my hobby (racing) sometimes I do spend time talking about these things but I should be focusing on other topics. I do believe everyone should have a passion and a hobby but as a lead I need to keep myself focused on ARGO topics. I am trying to transition from co-worker (down the street) to lead (ARGO) and I will work on this but I don't think its a terrible thing for others to see you have goals/passions outside of work. 

I am in the process of getting a better procedure for me to keep up with all the emails and slack messages. When I am in the car for long periods it has been tough for me to stay on top of those things. I will do a better job moving forward. 

I have lots to learn about being a Trainer, I started reading about personality differences and how people ingest information differently. I will keep taking the time to learn more about the different ways I can become a better Trainer. As I gain valuable experience in my position I will always be learning new skills that will make me a better teacher. 

I enjoy the interview process and evaluating people, but I could do a better job of asking better questions. I also think with more time doing this I will get better.

I need to not second guess myself, sometimes I think I am too hard on myself. I worry about stepping on toes instead of just doing things. ""Just Do It"" needs to be my new mentality.

I am open to all feedback sometimes I do think I am a bit thin skinned but I need feedback good/bad so I can take that information and use it to focus on doing a better job. 

I have experienced terrible leaders in my past which has given me the ability to know how I do NOT want to be. Now at ARGO I believe I have so many excellent role models to give me the template that I can use and make myself not only a better lead but a better person. My biggest fear is if I feel I am exceeding expectations but my peers and leaders do not see my performance in the same light, then I will need better guidance on what my expectations should be. I couldn't find detailed information on VOI (Training Focus) and VOII (Training Focus) to evaluate.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Team communication - Try to focus on being quicker to respond on Slack.  Knowing that you're quick to answer gives your team more confidence that they can count on you, and I think that you can focus a little more on keeping up with more channels so that you're available and more informed as well.  Once we're focusing more on AV training at New Stanton, quick remote communication becomes much more important, and poor communication can lead to lost training opportunities or missed messaging from the team.  We talked in person about our communication and I think we can both take it as an action item to communicate better as a training team to stay aligned on needs, plans, and messaging so that we are both on the same page and can build a more robust, informative training plan.

Try to be more confident in your answers when asked questions in front of a group, even if you simply don't know and need another opinion - no matter what the answer is, say it with confidence.  Occasionally you have the tendency to deflect the question to another SVO which is the right move, but make your messaging more confident and optimally reach out in private and share the answer in public so that everyone benefits from the experience - especially when it's something we need to talk about as a group away from the general VO pool first so that we as leads are aligned on an answer before having to give one on the spot.

Make it a point to focus more on troubleshooting techniques and diving more into the tech portion of how and why the car behaves as it does - being an expert in these areas is key to getting buy-in and respect from your trainees, and will also help you to be more confident when delivering talks on these subjects.  Assisting in troubleshooting will also help to alleviate some of the stress from the leads and attain greater efficiency when you can handle issues in your training car by yourself, whether on Slack or in person.",,,Steven Swartz,sswartz@argo.ai,Lisa Fischer,lfischer@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,

She will always respond, although _sometimes_ it can be a bit delayed.  This hasn't been an issue much to this point, but as we grow - it will be increasingly necessary to be attentive to incoming messages.

Lisa can have a tendency to second guess what she might be thinking at times - but she's very knowledgeable.  I know she will seek input to make sure she is relaying the consistent and correct information, although - often times she already knows the right answer, just needs to have more confidence to _know_ that she knows the right answer, and the confidence to press on when appropriate.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Lorena has made improvements with scheduling overall. She is working more closely with Jeremy and her hiring managers to secure panels and is asking the right questions in order to schedule effectively. 

Lorena works with the LiDAR team and schedules many interviews in the New Jersey office. She created Greenhouse templates for NJ onsites and also created a training guide for the office manager in NJ. She did something similar with the Vehicle Operations team when they rolled out interviews in Miami. She also works with the temp agency to schedule contractor interviews and will be developing a procedure for the RC guide. 

As the RC in Mountain View, Lorena can have up to 3 onsite interviews in a given day. She has made improvements in her ability to manage the candidates and empower them to come to her when necessary, instead of her checking in on them after each interview. This allows her to stay focused on her scheduling tasks throughout the day and attend meetings. 

Lorena's communication has greatly improved. I see detailed notes in Greenhouse between her and Jeremy, the hiring teams and the candidate. Lorena will anticipate an issue and reach out to Jeremy in advance to resolve the issue. She will also make me aware of possible issues if something needs to be handled before she arrives to the office. Lorena is communicating better with me and fellow RC's. 

We do not have a People Operations presence in the Mountain View office so Lorena handles tasks for them. She has improved her communication with that team to ensure new hire paperwork is in order, rooms are booked and Zooms are added to IT orientation. She ensures that the new hires get where they need to be on their first day and is a resource for them. She also handles tasks related to office coordination and event planning for the Mountain View office. She is very involved with the culture of the Mountain View office and enjoys that part of her role. ",,,Jessica Motz,jmotz@argo.ai,Lorena Villegas,lvillegas@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"This review cycle I have leaned on Lorena to take initiative when it comes to creating slack groups for my onsite interviews which have proven to be incredibly successful. Lorena has identified and followed up on details for driving interviews which were recently integrated into our vehicle operations onsite's. She makes sure the correct documents are sent to interviewers and makes sure interviewers send her signed documents for driving interviews. All of my Vehicle Operations interviews have gone on without a hitch. I also appreciate that Lorena is proactive and reaches out to a candidate when she doesn't receive a confirmation back. Another additional responsibility she has taken on are assisting with booking conference rooms for the Mapping/Labeling contractor onsite interviews. She created a google doc with schedules, rooms booked and candidate names for Elena and the interview panel to reference. She works very well cross functionally with people operations in PITT, with our office/facilities coordinator Yee and with those that she supports in Recruiting. 

In addition to her scheduling responsibilities Lorena has taken on a handful of additional responsibilities that she has taken ownership over because she genuinely cares. She has taken on onboarding and has been proactive about ensuring that when a new hire arrives they feel welcomed and they have a desk that is setup. She also goes out of her way to write birthday cards to those with birthdays at the end of each month. She has been successful in spearheading bring your kids to work day as well as been the point person for women at Argo. She is extremely personable to all candidates and approachable to all in our office who are familiar with Lorena from their onsite interview to their first day.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Lorena has done a fantastic job of taking care of the first day onboarding process for new hires in MTV, along with coordinating, planning, and participating in just about every activity that we have here in MTV. I think that the work that Lorena does beyond her job title is what makes her such a great person to work with. She's always willing to help, and she understands that we as an ops team aren't individuals, but team members that are constantly watching out for one another. 
Lorena did a great job planning the Women at Argo event at the Ronald McDonald house, along with helping plan Argo Kids Takeover, and also just simply trying to contribute and foster Argo culture throughout the quarter. I think that the work that she puts in can sometimes go unappreciated, but she really does put in a lot of time and effort into events, and she cares a lot about making sure that we have a great work environment and that other people also feel like Argo is a great place to be on a day-to-day basis. Overall, her job title might say RC, but the impact that she has goes far beyond recruiting, and ultimately transfers to our workplace as a whole.
The care that she has for displaying a welcoming and friendly environment at Argo can also be seen from how she treats her interview candidates. She'll approach them before they can even type in their name while they begin to sign in, and I can see that it puts the candidates at ease, especially since we don't have a reception area like PIT. She does a great job of guiding the candidates through their day, and I try to model myself after he whenever she might be caught in a meeting or emergency. 
One of the greatest points of growth that I've seen in Lorena has been her willingness to speak up when she feels like things aren't operating how they should be, or if she has an issue with how certain matters are being communicated to her. It's not always easy to speak up, but it's extremely important that we do since we're still a growing company and we want to continue to work as a lean and efficient machine. Open communication is key to this, and I've definitely seen Lorena take initiative to arrange meetings so that we can have a formal and open dialogue about what works and what doesn't for us as an ops team in MTV.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"I perform my core duties from the Mountain View office independently while also joining the MTV event committee (co-lead), Women at Argo Lead for D&I initiatives. I also assisted in organizing the Miami Office logistics for interviewers meeting with Tony Warywoda. I've assisted People Ops with new hires and posting immigration documents and organizing events within the office. (Kid's takeover Argo, Ronald McDonald House, Habitat for Humanity)

One of the largest projects within my team was reassessing job descriptions. 

I've made improvements in speaking directly to my lead or recruiter with issues occurring in the MTV office. 

I've offered solutions to better work within my team and recruiters. 

I like that my role has the ability to touch on both recruiting and people operations. I like that the team I work with allow to participate in D&I, employee events, candidate experience, employee experience and more. I like checking in with candidates who have become employees and being the first person they meet face to face at Argo. I enjoy being the point of contact for both Recruiting and People Operations. 

I'd like to continue in these areas and continue enhancing the interviewer and hiring manager training with recruiting as well as become a better source of information for employees with regards to People Operations. 

I've been able to not only perform the core duties as a Recruiting Coordinator but step in as needed as a People Ops Coordinator and Employee Experience lead. I've completed a large percentage of my core duties (on average 46% of in person onsites) while participating in a new hires first day at Argo MTV. (also nearly 46% for Q4 and Q1) on my own.

She definitely does her job, but also takes on tasks that are not typically part of the recruiting role- at least that I've seen. How often do you see an RC successfully organize an event committee and flawlessly execute an event like, Kid's takeover Argo? How often do you see RC's assist with facilities or IT tasks when we're OOO? How often do you see an RC as the go-to person for policies and processes and even general advice? It's very common for me to see other MTV employees ask her such questions, including myself.

",,,Wen Zhang,wzhang@argo.ai,Lucian Cesca,lcesca@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Since joining Argo in February, I’ve been consistently performing at the level of Senior Software Engineer.

I was the first member of the Offboard DevOps team when I joined in February. Since joining, I’ve improved processes across the Offboard team and Argo as whole. I’ve significantly improved infrastructure of the ingest pipeline, containerized deployment environments, and created a culture around and developed processes to ensure safe and stable use of Terraform and AWS at Argo. To ensure the success of various teams at Argo, I have provided cross-functional support for this ecosystem as it is adopted.

**Best Practices and AWS**
Upon joining I quickly generated a backlog of missing best practice recommendations for Argo’s use of AWS and cloud resources and worked with my manager, Lee, to prioritize these issues and fit them into other team focus worked. Many of these issues are still outstanding, however still made significant progress to improve our DevOps best practices.  I established the patterns for safe and secure use of Terraform by ensuring that Terraform state was stored encrypted in S3 and that one only user could be apply automated changes at the same time.  This prevents any corruption of Argo’s AWS infrastructure as more developers use Terraform to manage resources in AWS. I created a Consul cluster that can be used for cross-team service discovery.  As Offboard and other teams begin to rely on each other’s deployed cloud resources this cluster will help smooth transitions and prevent friction between teams as they deploy new services and applications to AWS. Additionally, I introduced the 12 Factor Application pattern to the Offboard team.  This pattern allows the team to set low-level expectations of how our services and containers should be structured to ease deployment, reduce development complexity, and share foundational development patterns across the team.  More recently I rolled out security changes to AWS that protect our raw vehicle logs in argoai-snowball from any unintentional destructive changes, and established a pattern for periodic auditing of this access and future auditing of access to similar data.  I’ve also helped to enforce AWS tagging policies and investigate our AWS usage in March help us understand our AWS usage and costs.  This work helps to keep Argo running smoothly day to day and ensure that our AWS use is measurable and cost-effective.

**Ingest Pipeline Infrastructure**
Shortly after joining Argo I worked closely with the Offboard Data Core team to improve numerous aspects of the data ingest pipeline. First I automated the creation of Elastic Map Reduce clusters (used to turn raw logs in Sequence files). This work allowed us to define appropriate access policies for both development and production clusters, it also allows us to quickly and confidently make changes to the production cluster if the need arises.  This automation is also often used to quickly create (and cleanup) development clusters to help ensure ingest pipeline code is well tested before production.
I’ve also made numerous improvements to the automation used to create Hortonworks Data Platform clusters (used for Zeppelin, Parquet generation, and video decompression) that allowed for more flexibility when launching clusters and hardened the clusters against market changes to AWS.  I allowed new clusters to be launched with a mix of on-demand and spot EC2s, this change allows each cluster to balance reliability (by ensuring critical services stay running) and cost (by allowing most work to be completed on much cheaper spot EC2s).  This work also allowed for each HDP cluster to take a different shape.  This was important to ensure that video decompression remains reliable and cost effective by allowing a different mix of instances to be used to maximize resource utilization on the cluster. I also made configuration changes to Zeppelin to allow notebooks to be stored on S3.  This ensure that notebooks are automatically backed up can be automatically shared between clusters easing transitions between Zeppelin clusters.  I also coordinated efforts between the Data Core and IT teams to release automation to the log upload terminals that allows for automatic deployment of the log upload package to each log upload terminal when a new release is available without manual intervention.

**Containerized Deployment Platform**
I’ve created the first version of a containerized deployment platform running on Kubernetes to be used by Offboard and other teams at Argo.  While this platform is still in its infancy, it is seeing production use by the Jobs Platform for simulations and is used to run Metabase (go/metrics). This platform is also being used by Overwatch and Data Core for new development work and its use is being POCd by the Map Build team and Perception Infrastructure. This automation is able to automatically create new Kubernetes clusters for teams with minimal manual intervention that automatically conform to our best practices for AWS usage to help ensure safe and secure access to our tools. It also allows for teams to easily make changes to the shape of their clusters to support evolving workloads of their services. This deployment platform also automatically sends host-level and container-level metrics to Datadog to help teams monitor their services.  As well as automatically capturing all logs sending them to an Elasticsearch cluster of easy searching and debugging in Kibana. Migrating Metabase to one of these clusters has resolved the performance issues that had previously been plaguing Metabase. As of this writing Metabase has been stable for over 3 weeks without receiving any performance complaints or requiring any manual interventions. Prior to this transition Metabase was receiving multiple performance complains and requiring numerous touches a week to stay responsive. This platform is providing a solid foundation for containerized cloud deployments that will continue to be adopted by Offboard services, and other teams at Argo.

**Cross-functional Support**
In addition to focused best-practice work and team support I’ve provided broad cross-functional support to teams across Argo.  I’ve balanced these requests while still delivering the more focus value discussed above.  An example of the types of cross functional support I’ve delivered is helping teams (ie. localization, for example) set up new S3 buckets and the corresponding AWS access policies.  Additionally, I created automation to allow teams to set-up internal, statically hosted, website on S3 to host reporting.  This automation has created reporting sites used by the motion control, localization, detection, and TPM teams saving each time the time necessary to set up a system themselves (or unintentionally releasing a public-facing website).  I’ve begun transitioning Triage infrastructure (Cloud Replay and Log Slicing) over to the Offboard DevOps team, this will allow us to ensure that this automation is well supported and aligns with the rest of Offboard’s infrastructure. I also help teams understand the limitations and opportunities of deploying to cloud environments, for example helping the Overwatch team understand the networking concerns of connecting Overwatch to the VDS or helping the IT team understand limitations of enabling cloud-auditing systems inside of AWS.

Overall, this evidence shows that I have been consistently performing as a Senior Software Engineer since joining Argo. I’ve been able to work independently to deliver a broad range of projects improving teams across Argo, while helping ensure best practices are developed with our use of AWS, and providing tactical support to teams across Argo as it has been requested.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"While I’ve had significant accomplishments since joining Argo that doesn’t mean I don’t still have areas where I could improve.

While I was the only member of the Offboard DevOps team I could have done better communicating timelines and priorities when numerous teams were asking me to investigate “high priority” issues.  In these circumstances I need to provide regular communication to all parties, even when there isn’t a meaningful update yet because I am still working on another issue.  As the team as now grown I will also need to help to ensure that the entire Offboard DevOps team is able to provide solid communication even in the face of competing priorities.

Similarly, I’ve struggled to give good “clock time” estimates for projects. My workday if often interrupt and support driven. This results in extra context switches and complicates giving good estimates for projects.  I need to continue to improve in my ability to estimate in the face of this, as well as ensure that I am taking steps to protect my development time so that I continue to deliver long-term strategic value to Argo.

I hope to work with my new Tech Lead and continue to work with Lee to address these issues and continue to grow at Argo.

Don't be afraid to ask questions or ask for help - I think there is always a fear that when new processes or procedures come into play that you get it all right in the first shot but that is rarely the case. We have lots of moving parts/pieces and it is different than what you have been used to.  I want you to speak up going forward. In the end there are no dumb questions. 

Visibility - We need you to be our eyes and ears for all things procurement, facilities & shipping receiving in NJ. That doesn't mean you do it all on your own but if you see something seems to be a miss please bring it to the forefront so we close the loop. An example is the furniture in relation to the tables. If you voice it once and you don't see any motion feel free to bring it up to me or run it up the flagpole. I want this team to be as open as possible and we are all here to help each other. 

Think scale - Certainly some of the systems that were used in the past worked but now we have to take it to the next level. A question for the you and the team is how do we make entering PO's easier?

**Projects & Technical Skill**

**Highlights**: 
1.  Designed & implemented the initial Triage Platform (POC) which included
         Triage Web App 
         Triage Backend Server 
         Triage Media Streaming Server (Wowza Proxy) 
         RDS Setup and DB Schema
    *Initially wrote the triage app in js using jquery and angularjs but then re wrote the backend in JAVA and supported Mark with frontend rewrite to Typescript.

2. Designed & implemented the Log Ingestion Apps (Homer)
        Log Ingestion Front end (Typescript/React/Redux)
        Log Ingestion Back end (Java)
        DB 

3. Setup Metabase & the maintenance work
        Metabase started of as a product to use internally in PA team. It quickly became company wide used app. Currently has the most number users signed up for it. 

4. Learned and set up lot of devops tools for deployment 
         AWS EC2, RDS, Network Load balancer, Elastic Beanstalk
         Marathon Mesos

5. Overwatch 
       API Design Spec & API Gateway Setup
       Allegheny Server Design and Implementation
       Learned  and Implemented ActiveMQ and gRPC server streaming
       Building out the CI/CD pipeline

**Triage App (Frontend & Backend - POC)**
At ago I was hired as a backend engineer with a focus on JAVA language for development, however when the team was in a definite need of someone to help build out the frontend and backend Triage App. I took this responsibility, designed and architected the V0 version of the Triage App. My initial design of Triage App consisted of technologies Node.js, Angular.js, and Javascript. I had no knowledge of how to use these frameworks or ever build a frontend web app in past. I quickly learned these technologies and delivered a POC of Triage app within 1 week. After the POC I added the JIRA creation and video streaming functionalities to the app. At this point the app was now able to show some data and play videos for that data as well create JIRA tickets for it.

**Triage App (Media server) **
Another big part of the Triage project, I worked on was the Triage Media server. This media server was a proxy server to the  Wowza Streaming Engine. The purpose of this media server was to stream argonaut view from our ec2 box to the Triage Web app. This app was built using javascript, nodejs, and Wowza streaming engine APIs. While building this application I made myself become familiar streaming protocols such as HLS, RTMP as well how to stream a UDP stream across a server to a web browser. This media server included unit tests as well as integration tests with nearly full coverage of the codebase. During the time I built this app, there were no devops, so I also learned how to set up a Wowza streaming engine in the aws and configure the UDP ports for streaming. 

Video streaming was the core part of Initial version of Triage web app and to make sure the videos were being served properly I spent time building a tool to benchmark the RTMP streaming the web app and how long the buffer load time was taking. After the findings I worked on changing the design to stream videos from the S3 directly 

**Triage App (Frontend & Backend POC refactor to productize) **
As the triage team grew we soon decided to make changes to the Triage POC app. As part of this refactor I assisted Mark with changing the backend code of triage from nodejs/js to a JAVA server. I also helped him with moving some of the features of the frontend code from angularjs to typescript with react and redux frameworks in place. I put lot of input in the design of the database schema. Lastly, spent lot of time helping productization by dockerizing the Triage App as well as the media server. 

**Metabase**
I was asked to help with Metabase when it had crashed and we lost all of the data in December. I was able to retrieve the old backup file and took time to set up metabase correctly. I learned how to use H2 databases and productize metabase setup correctly. Metabase started of as a product to use internally in PA team. It quickly became company wide used app. Currently has the most number users signed up for it and using it, which cause more performance issue recently that I helped address. 

**Homer App**
Recently I built, Homer an log ingestion web app to monitor and control jobs that currently show ingestion of logs from the bricks to our S3 bucket. I designed the Homer frontend, backend and databases. I designed, architected the application from finish to end,  delivered the full app 1 month ahead of schedule. I worked with Wen and the final users Matt and his team to gather requirements to make sure what I was building was going to be useful for the team. Matt team was very happy with the final product are actively using the app to monitor and track jobs. Homer was built using the latest technology and keeping scale in mind. I used similar architect as Triage to keep the foundation of our web application similar and easier for team members to collaborate and move across project. I spent time learning the Google APIs to add secure authentication to Homer with permission to allow only certain people in the company to modify things on the application. Instead of building everything from scratch for Homer UI, I tried to take advantage of libraries such react bootstrap table which allowed me to cut development time of the app by almost half. I am also helping Claire from Systems team in building a similar app and using similar libraries. Homer was dockerize and deployed with logging to uncover and debug issue. I also spent time putting up a dev instance where Wen and I could test things without affecting the production environment. 

**Overwatch**
For the past month my primary focus has been designing and building out the Overwatch TaaS application. I have helped design and contribute my feedback on the major components in this system, and how the major components of this system interact. I have taken ownership of building the event stream processor also know as Allegheny. Allegheny uses AmazonMQ for its messaging service and sends out callbacks over the gRPC server stream. Both of these technologies I was unfamiliar with and have never worked with in past. I quickly brought myself familiar with them and have already designed, and implemented an initial version of this server, which meets all of these requirements ahead of the anticipated milestone timelines. 

Besides, Allegheny I have been helping and contributing on various other parts of the overwatch project, I have helped design the TaaS REST APIs and authentication layer. Designed the Overwatch DB schema with Mark to use by Overwatch services such as Viaduct, Allegheny. I have learned how to use Amazon API Gateway and have setup up our API server there for Ford to test. I leveraged the work Vivek had done for Offboard repo and setup the CI/CD for overwatch team. We now have jenkins building and testing all of our PRs in the overwatch repo. Currently I am working on designing CD approach for the overwatch with multiple environments with continuous deployment to. I am also looking into what approach to take for nightly end to end spec test suite to run.

**Growth** 
I have grown in building frontend development especially in **react** and **redux** frameworks, picked up a new language **Typescript**, which is new and upcoming. I have helped architect and design manys aspects of offboard projects: triage, ingest pipeline, overwatch. 

I have also helped my peers with there projects, whether it is providing meaningful code reviews, participating in design & architecture discussions. 

Became a interviewer and helped in hiring for a variety of technical roles

I have raised concerns to team leads, and peers for projects and features at risk or when things are not being done correctly and need a different approach. 

Focused on building team culture and cross collaborations amongst team members. Tried my best to build culture between teams after the reorg. 

From reading go/levels expectations for a SWI, I feel I have been exceeding expectations and already have been performing as SWII in my day to day work at Argo.

- Over the past few months, he has worked on a wide variety of things like - building the Triage backend server, Triage media server, Homer app/backend server, few parts of the Triage App, maintaining metabase, designing parts of Overwatch to name a few. 
- His strenghts are mostly are building web servies, building APIs, DB schema design, JAVA launguage etc
- He is totally willing to step out of his comfort zones to pick new languages, technologies, tools in order to deliver services/apps which his team really needs. He is also quick learner which often puts him on a path to success
- He is approachable and does not hesitate in sharing his opinions and thoughts in any of the technical discussions in the team. His insights and inputs have mostly been useful for the team and his active participation in all the discussions blend well making him a valuable asset to his team.

**Summary:** I personally feel he is performing way beyond the expectations from a Software Engineer 1 and should definitely be a candidate for a promotion to the next level.

We will not be able to deliver Homer this early without Madhav's hard work. He demonstrate some great virtues during the work on Homer.
1. He has a good understanding of user needs and can predicate user's requirement. Say for Homer's server end, he correctly predicate his existing code on state limit server will be enough and reuse the existing design.
2. He is open minded. When we have suggestions/idea, he's willing to listen.
3. He's fast, the turn around time for any fix/update is almost instant.  

For Overwatch, he also make great contributions. Demonstrate that he is willing to and totally capable to take ownership of a project.
1. He's part of all discussions, contributed to the entirety of the design. Draft the first version of API documents and iterates on it.
2. He takes ownership of the API gateway, fix a numerous amount of issues to make sure we can deliver it on time.

3. Metabase- Better logging and should of set it up in cluster.

Overwatch team has taken the initiative to use Kotlin for the language instead of JAVA which is challenge for me as I am not familiar with Kotlin and I am slowly learning the language. 

Part of the Overwatch stack we are using RabbitMq for the messaging queue, however I am familiar with Kafka so learning RabbitMq is somewhere I can grow.

But, his contributions at Argo have mostly been in the areas of building web services, backend s/w etc. He might not have gotten a chance to get some exposure to the software stack closer to the vehicle (AV stack, simulation etc) and hence may not be aware of the intricacies and challenges related to them. 
- He spending some time trying to understand them and to be part of a couple of tasks which need some knowledge of the AV stack will help him gain some perspective and measure on things which have not been his core areas. This will help him learn a few more things and also will enable him to appreciate the efforts that goes into building s/w in those areas.

2. Wrote DataDog annotation wrappers for python and java so that any offbaord modules can be instrumented for run time profiling -- https://app.datadoghq.com/dash/576578/log-ingestion-status?live=true
2.1 later all of data ingest pipeline tasks were instrumented using this wrapper 
2.2 built a datadog dashboard to monitor run time statistics for ingest pipeline

3. Added support for quite a few new Messages which were lacking .asl in Parquet by writing custom serialization routines in AV code base.

4. Built message deserialization monitor to automatically detect message deserialization failures in the ingest pipeline -- https://app.datadoghq.com/monitors/4176699
4.1 the engine successfully detected new messages that are not supported yet by the offboard
4.2 the engine detected all the supported messages deserialization failures and alerted the offboard team on time. This way the errors and failures didn't slip through the cracks and errors never went unnoticed for weeks like before.

5. Took over the ownership of offboard feature branch in AV repo and helped merge that was blocking the offboard CI and CD
5.1 wrote new sandbox tools for message parsers
5.2 incorporated all suggestions and tons of review comments that were pending for more several months

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"I have had a few projects since starting with Argo and I believe they fall into two main focus areas; Data and Reporting. 

1) **Data**
* Org Chart Now: One of my first projects at Argo was to assist Kyle with a data restructure to create our current organizational model of Team, Sub-Team and Functional Team.  For this project, I organized the information from managers, created ADP validation tables and custom fields, entered and cleaned the data in an import file, and then audited the information once it was uploaded into ADP.   The project was a success and we were able to use the new data configuration to set up Org Chart Now in a usable way for our employee population.  I think this project really helped me to learn the organization's structure and leadership, and allowed me to take a crash course in Google Sheets (I had mostly used Excel in the past).
* EEO data:  One of my more recent projects was to complete our EEO-1 Report. When I started to look at our EEO data, I noticed that many of the job classifications in ADP were either missing or were inconsistent between the same job titles. I did a full audit of the job classifications and then updated the data where necessary.  I also tied the corrected job classifications to the appropriate job titles in ADP to ensure accuracy in the future.  I then worked with Bri to gather the EEO demographic data which we currently collect and store via Google suite.  To consolidate this data and make this process less manual going forward, I imported the EEO demographic data into ADP so that all of our EEO information is now housed in the same system.  These improvements will allow us to have more accurate and complete EEO data which will make EEO-1 reporting much easier for next year.  We will also be able to build viable diversity reports, supporting one of our key initiatives. 
* ADP: I'm continually working on improving the quality and completeness of our ADP data.  One of the main ways I have done this so far is by updating the ADP validation tables to include our standardized job titles and align those titles the appropriate pay grade, FLSA and EEO job classifications.  This makes the data entry of new hires or job changes more efficient and it ensures greater data accuracy. I also manage our EMM file and do regular audits on the relevant information housed there to ensure it is as accurate and complete as possible. Beyond this, I have also reconfigured the ADP home page to make it more appealing to employees and am looking into increasing our ADP self service options.  

2)**Reporting**
* Turnover Reporting:  I created a custom ADP turnover report and summary dashboards for our internal review and analyses.  This will help us spot trends and track our historical, year to date, and rolling turnover information. 
* Inversion Analysis: I built a file to spot any compensation or level inversions that may exist in our organization.  We are able to use this to identify any outliers of our banding system and to address any mis-leveling. 
* Unum File Feed:  I've just finished building a large custom report out of ADP that we can (hopefully) use as an electronic file feed for our disability and FMLA claims.  This will help to make this process less manual and more automated.   
* Group Term Life Calculations: I created a file to manually calculate our employee's monthly group term life costs for January - April 2018.  This has now been set up as an automatic calculation through ADP, but building the file allowed me to gain greater knowledge of our life insurance policy and recognize how the employee costs are calculated.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Org Chart Now

The live org chart that feeds out of ADP was one of Maria's most impressive accomplishments.  Before she and Kyle implemented this, the org chart lived in a slide and had to be manually updated.  The new org chart is a much better solution that saves time and money.  Also, the fact that she and Kyle tackled the ever-changing complexity of the SW teams' organization was very brave!

EEO Data

Before Maria, the EEO data was largely outside of ADP, and what was in ADP was inconsistent (same titles had different EEO job classifications, for example.)  This made the 2017 year-end reporting difficult, so her standardization of titles and classifications, and moving the data in ADP, will save a ton of time at year end, but also will provide insight into our staff diversity.

EMM and General EE Data

Before the change in POps management, the EMM (old source of truth before ADP HRIS) was riddled with errors and inconsistencies, but Maria has worked hard to keep it organized and accurate.  

GTL

In order to implement group term life insurance, we had to manually add in 1st quarter amounts, and Maria efficiently calculated these for the whole organization.

EE Onboarding

Maria took over from Briana entering new hires into ADP.  She is very efficient; new hires are entered in our system the morning of their first day.  This is important for the Finance team, as we often have tight payroll deadlines with new hires.  Going forward, we need to refine the responsibilities between POps and Finance so that employee documents have higher quality control.

She also standardized titles/levels/EEO/FLSA, which keeps the organization consistent and saves data entry time and errors.

Interpersonal/Work Ethic

I have consistently been pleased by how personable, kind and hard-working Maria is.  She is a great coworker - she always works hard, without complaining, delivering on time or before, and I know that if I am working with her on a project, that she will add value.  Her willingness to learn does her credit.",,,Lilli Cannon,lcannon@argo.ai,Maria Beshalske,mbeshalske@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Maria has been a great addition to the People Ops team. Maria is responsible for our data and reporting and is a main contact for our ADP relationship. One of the man tasks that I worked on with Maria was transferring our Employee Matrix to ADP. Maria and I worked together on confirming team structures and reporting structures. Maria was extremely organized throughout the process and cleaned up the reporting structure very quickly. 

One of the main projects Maria worked on was implementing a new Org chart. This coincided with understanding and cleaning up the org and reporting structure.  This has been a huge help for the onboarding process.  The org chart was manually updated before and was outgrowing the confines of google slides. With Maria's help, the new org chart accurately defines each team and updates automatically. 

Maria has also taken on adding new hire information into ADP, a huge task. Maria acts quickly and is extremely accurate in her work. From the data she is adding in, she is also running reports weekly to update subjects like, head count, attrition, diversity and missing employee data. Maria's work setting up these reports and automatically running them saves hours of work. 

Maria has built out several internal POps reports that have made a huge difference. Maria helped me build a report for securely uploading  employee information to Ford for their A Plan and Voucher information. This report was previously done by hand and took time to pull together each month. Maria has also helped me form a report to pull employees start dates to recognize one year anniversaries and birthdays. Maria is always thinking about protecting employee information and was able to craft these reports to fit that premise. ",,,Mike Fitzpatrick,mfitzpatrick@argo.ai,Maria Beshalske,mbeshalske@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"These feedback sections are in order of occurrence, not importance:

**People Ops Responsibility Transfer**
Maria was my first/only hire at Argo. She was brought on to alleviate me of what inevitably was happening, I was becoming the go-to person for employee data asks (a full-time job). Hiring her to handle this task was critical to ensure that I could fulfill my role during the time, temporary People Ops lead. Situational complications aside, Maria dove right into the employee data situation post a 'hurricane-like' situation. She was given a month to be on-boarded by me before becoming fully responsible for employee data, as I was to transition back to the Recruiting team. She quickly learned the many quirks of our data and took over ownership of weekly employee data reporting and maintenance. I am extremely impressed with her ability to understand how the employee matriculation workbook works, in and out, a daunting task for almost everyone! She also took over entering new hires into ADP, a time-draining task that requires 100% accuracy. 

**Org Chart**
Maria assisted me from a data perspective with the OrgChart Now implementation. She was critical in working with me to collect and upload additional data (nicknames, badge photos, preferred titles, sub-teams, and functional teams) so the final product would be useful to the organization. She sat in on several meetings to better understand how the ADP data she maintains as part of her role would feed directly into OrgChart Now. She remained extremely patient throughout the drawn-out process because of several issues during the implementation on OrgChart Now's end.

**Ad-Hoc Analysis**
Maria has been excellent in owning the growing number of employee data analysis requests in the org as we scale. In her role, she is primarily taking on the burden of completing these asks from a People Ops perspective. I have been impressed with her ability to kick-off these requests, without almost any assistance. If I am consulted, she is interesting in learning how to better herself and expand her capabilities. To my knowledge, she has been involved with the following analyses: inversion, turnover, supervisors over time, and team spread by location.

**Org Structure**
 Maria has been an excellent business partner (between myself and Jen DeBrincat) in identifying and maintaining the organizational structure (team, sub-team, functional team). If changes occur, she is responsible for communicating and/or directly making the updates to most systems or processes for teams or employees affected.

**Headcount**
Recently, Maria has become the People Ops headcount liaison from a data perspective. She is working closely with Jen DeBrincat, Jen Honick, Jenn Gustin, and myself to manage a challenging process in a ever-changing organization that is quickly growing. The ADP data she is responsible for maintaining directly impacts downstream processes. I have been impressed with her ability to keep up, especially in something that is sink or swim.",,,Kyle Neff,kneff@argo.ai,Maria Beshalske,mbeshalske@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Maria has jumped right in and done a lot of great work as our HRIS & Compliance Analyst.  She has a strong understanding of what the department needs and actively defines and implementes improvements.

She took over all of the data entry into ADP which can be incredibly time consuming.  Maria has a high level of accuracy and excellent understanding of data, data integrity, and reporting.  Her work has immensely helped cut down the time taken during the onboarding process and better allows POps to provide out better reporting.  

Maria did an amazing job on Org Chart Now!  With teams growing and changing constantly as sub-teams and functional-teams are better defined this was no easy task.

She was able to take over collecting EEO demographic data and ensure all compliance needs were met in reporting for the EEO-1 Report.  The data we had on record needed a lot of clean up and additional work to add information Argo previously had not defined.  Maria was not only great to collaborate with in and drive this project to completion but she was also able to work with Legal to ensure for 2018 reporting due in 2019 the process is setup to run even smoother. 

I feel much more confident now that Maria has taken over ADP data and the EMM.  A huge accomplishment was getting ADP to finally address updating the PLI employee files as Argo would like them reflected in ADP.  She’s made a lot of good changes even small one’s such as updating the ADP background and appearance that make ADP nicer for POps and our employees.  ADP Customer Service is not easy to work with but she manages coordinating with the services we have available to fix problems.  

She has been an excellent source of support in both generating FML reporting for our collaboration with UNUM as well creating Group Term Life calculations to help POps and Payroll quickly update and implement imputed income taxes.  

Maria is always quick to help and volunteer solutions or assistance.  She’s a great team player and very self driven in finding solutions.  Building the FML report for UNUM has not been straightforward and there are limitations to the data ADP can population, but Maria took everything head on and found solutions that work.  

Maria brings a positive attitude, a wealth of knowledge, and drives team work within  and outside of POps.  She is great to work with and I look forward to continue collaborating with her on benefits and compliance needs.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Maria would do well to increase her knowledge of regulatory body compliance issues; occasionally new hires submitted incomplete payroll paperwork, and then parts of their tax setup was missing or incorrect in payroll.  Knowing what is required of employees and of us as an employer helps us be compliant.

I agree with her self-assessment that expanding her audits would be great.  The EE files, for one, and other HR-related systems of record need to be regularly audited for the inevitable error creep.  Hopefully the completion of these large projects will free up time for more auditing.

Occasionally, Maria can be too self-effacing, which hides her skill.  She would do well to speak up and not be afraid to offer ideas or solutions.",,,Lilli Cannon,lcannon@argo.ai,Maria Beshalske,mbeshalske@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"As I before, Maria has been a great addition to the team and has made a true impact. Her work alone in data protection and organization has been truly a life saver. 

I think Maria has great opportunity in the next months and coming year.  I would love to see Maria step out of the departments she works with the most closely and offer her expertise company wide. Maria has already taken this step and is now working with the SW team to help them with reporting.  I think there are many more departments that Maria can help with and truly have a great impact. With time, I think it would be great for Maria to start self identifying those opportunities and needs and addressing them on her own.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"**Assertiveness**
Maria should feel comfortable being assertive in a way that she challenges and flags actions that interfere with data integrity, as it is one of the most important tasks in her job. I think in time she will become more comfortable directly questioning everyone and everything to understand the potential impact (risks/benefits). Doing so is not seen as confrontational or overbearing, it is her doing her job. As an analyst, sometimes she will have to call out things that are not so obvious to the non-analyst. The area of growth/improvement is for her to feel empowered to do so (and crafting her approach), not in bettering the knowledge or skill-set required for her role.",,,Kyle Neff,kneff@argo.ai,Maria Beshalske,mbeshalske@argo.ai,General & Administrative,

Prior to my joining Argo, Mark had already kicked off discussions about the new ROIC and outlined the thrust of the new ROIC development. When I joined Argo in January, Mark quickly helped me get up to speed on the technical background needed for my work. He also took time to introduce me to our key vendor (SRI) for readout integrated circuit development and helped me develop a good working relationship with them which will be critical to the projects success. When I need information or his input to keep going with my work he gets back to me quickly and follows up to make sure I have what I need to move the ROIC development forward.

ME is an exceptional individual contributor; he had the challenging task of phasing out from his legacy commitments that were substantial and highly dependent on his personal technical skills, at the same time when he had to redirect his team to a full-fledged effort on the Argo LiDAR. He has juggled these technical efforts well and the company has been able to live with its commitments on every front: Northrop, Ball, ROIC, FPGA change, etc.
•    Technical Management
ME managed to transition his engineers and define new tasks related to the Argo LiDAR. One of the key risk in our implementation is the ROIC developed by SRI, a critical component from a delicate supplier. Mark quickly reached out to a previous contractor, with specific technical expertise in ROIC design, had him hired and mitigated that risk quickly. 
At the same time, he organized the task breakdown of the electronic architecture of the LiDAR for his team in a way that folks are focused on their areas of expertise and cooperate actively.

ME has made a key hire, reorganized tasks in an effective manner pertinent to the new objectives of the team. He has also solved some early transition glitches related to wrong leveling and other post-merger issues.
He has a central role in helping with the phasing-out of our legacy business and, despite the fact that it is a distracting burden on him, he handles that extra work with grace.

ME is an active contributor to the core meetings, but is not feeling comfortable enough that his opinion is relevant; it is a gain for the Company and for the management team if he contributes his opinion more actively. 
He is extremely perceptive of the dynamics of people, and that gives him an insight that management must use to anticipate and mitigate issues.
If he is given more authority (that he admits he has a hard time commandeering himself), he can handle much larger tasks beyond his technical skill set, such as complex and time sensitive program management.",,,Yves Dzialowski,yves@argo.ai,Mark Entwistle,mentwistle@argo.ai,Hardware,

The Argo development framework is quite different than that used by legacy PLI.  There has been a dedicated effort to adopt to the new workflow, some have picked it up easier than others, however, we need a common understanding and common implementation in order to run more smoothly and on schedule.
Recommend facility-wide training, especially tailored to implementation in our HW/SW hybrid environment, (avoid common pitfalls and reduce learning curve)

-> Find correct balance between group direction and detailed design tasks:
This has been complicated by legacy support tasks, leaving LiDAR electronics management sub-optimal.  I would expect this to resolve by the end of Q2

-> Desire to expand responsibilities into cross-team issue resolution, maximize Argo's probabilities for success.

-> Improve ability to effectively use tools provided (Google Suite, Jira, Jama, etc.) 

-> Speak up more frequently in meetings!

Primarily because of the special circumstance that I was working on a legacy project, we do not have a regular 1:1 meeting schedule.  We would, however, meet up regularly to discuss issues on the Oakley project as was required for the project.  Since my portion of that project is now complete, there might be some benefit to create a regular 1:1 meeting schedule.

There is no fluff. He tells suppliers what we need, relays expectations, determines the quickest next step, and thanks them for their efforts.

Mark was able to negotiate the price of the V100 GPUs down a significant amount. Mark also provided useful recommendations for when to purchase parts and components. I knew I would need a specific capacitor for the VIC PCBA in AVS, and Mark recommended buying them in bulk at an earlier date. The part was completely out of stock a few days after he recommended buying them due to high industry demand.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"_Accomplishments and Results:_

1.  Guided transition of PLI organization into Argo organization
- Worked with LiDAR team to embrace Argo culture; championed the adoption of Argo development processes (e.g., OKRs, cross-site collaboration), development tools (e.g., G-Suite tools), and management processes (e.g., 1:1s)
- Capitalized on common aspects of both company cultures, such as openness and transparency in communication (monthly LiDAR All-Hands meetings to mirror company-wide All-Hands)
- Managed downsizing of legacy team with minimal disruption to morale and focus

2.  Organized NJ team into a single coherent Argo LiDAR development team with sole focus on a single LiDAR product
- Structured incumbent NJ staff into focused sub-system teams, needed to re-organize from much smaller team with distributed responsibilities for PLI LiDAR development activity to include entire staff with better defined engineering roles
- Added roles that did not previously exist within PLI and guided individuals into these roles (e.g., TPM)

3.  Guided NJ team in defining program structure and details for Argo LiDAR development and in first six months of execution to this plan
- Definition of overall program structure (schedule, milestones, budget, cost scaling estimates)
- Definition of requirements and specifications for 2018 AL1 development
- Oversight for technical direction based on initial LiDAR concept from Oct 2017, including moderation/tie-break in instances of technical disagreement
- Organized and led periodic comprehensive reviews with Argo leadership team detailing LiDAR progress (requirements reviews, architecture/program reviews)
- Interfaced with Ford on Argo LiDAR goals (schedule, performance, cost, etc.)
- Q1 OKRs scored at ~70%

4.  Defined new hires needed for LiDAR team and championed recruiting efforts
- Established recruiting as key responsibility for myself and team leads, and reinforced priority on recruiting activities

5.  Executive-level engagement with key vendors
- SRI ROIC negotiation, EPC driver circuit evaluation, IQE growth/GCS processing, Moog rotating platform

6.  Engagement of resources from across Argo to support LiDAR team
- Recruiting:  for new hires
- GSM:  on vendor negotiation (primarily SRI ROIC) and LiDAR RFP for manufacturing partner
- Legal:  on IP/patents and vendor negotiations
- Operations:  for facility upgrade/move planning
- Finance:  on LiDAR budget and PLI wind-down

7.  Ensured minimal distraction from LiDAR development by rapid re-orienting away from legacy PLI business
- Handed off organizational ownership of legacy customers to Yves and Joe
- Minimized involvement of key technical staff in legacy business transition activities

_Growth and improvements:_

1.  Worked to understand the way Argo is organized as a company and adapted my role within the NJ team to fit this organization
- Beyond leading development team, provided cross-functional leadership in GM-like role with interface to other Argo functional teams (e.g., Facilities, IT, Legal, Finance, People Ops)

2.  Embraced Argo resources for collaborative development
- Argo engages in more complex collaborative processes than PLI did based on being a multi-site, high growth rate organization, and I have worked to rapidly adopt these processes
- G-Suite tools and other IT tools employed by Argo can be great for efficiency if used effectively; I’ve worked to make sure I’m effective using them myself and have pushed my team to do the same

His positive demeanor and level-headedness provide anchors that foster team engagement and open discussion.  He is a role model for myself and others to follow. 

edit 5/9: Originally, I gave Mark a score of 3 due to the fact that he exceeded my personal expectations.  However, a score of 3 suggests promotion above VP, which doesn't make sense in our current organization, which is why I reduced the score to 2.

Mark is continuing to build an impressive Argo LiDAR team.   I have only been at Argo for 1.5 months, so my assessment is limited to that time frame.   Due to the acquisition, the focus of the company has evolved and narrowed a great deal.  Along with the expansion, merging the existing team with new members can be challenging.  Everyone's role is changing or being defined during this period and Mark seems to be handling this transition very well, and putting the foundations in for a very strong team that will no doubt be successful.     

Mark is very open and collaborates well with everyone.  He clearly listens to his team, and lets everyone's voice be heard.      

We have had several 1:1's, which are very helpful for me to get assimilated.  We have discussed my role in the group as a TPM/Senior Engineer, which evolves the more I get involved.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,report,"Mark itzler serves as the VP of LiDAR.

Mark had the mammoth task of reorganizing the legacy PLI team and environment to an Argo LiDAR system workflow.  This involved transitioning the company from a “many varied and custom projects” to a cohesive single system development team.  Team allocations and responsibilities were solidified based on LiDAR system development needs; new departments and roles were created to realize the new structure.  Mark sought advice from his managers on various schema and assignments.

Another early challenge was the quick adoption of the Argo workflow and collaboration tools, Mark quickly adapted to the new workflow and ensured that all groups began using it quickly as well.

It had been established before the acquisition closing that the LiDAR team would need to be expanded aggressively.  A significant amount of time has been dedicated, (and continues to be dedicated) to these efforts, as it is essential we continue to build the teams.  Mark has been successful in identifying and supporting the filling these roles with highly qualified people.    

To keep the wider team informed, Mark conducts LiDAR all-hands meetings to promote cross department knowledge and also serves as an open forum for questions and concerns.
He also conducts both managerial and external 1:1 reviews for purposes of exchanging issues and guidance.

Mark provides executive external vendor engagement in development contract negotiation, (SRI, IQE, EPC, etc.).  Mark was critical in creation of the deal for the SRI ROIC development, using previously established relationships to pull in the proper parties.  Mark’s perspective on negotiations with SRI proved invaluable to keeping the deal moving to closure.

Mark remains actively involved with the device design team for valuable guidance and review.  His knowledge and experience in this area is unsurpassed. 

Mark has been proactive in the engagement of Argo wide resources, spanning areas from recruiting to legal.  This has been essential for integration of PLI into the Argo team on all levels.  These efforts have also resulted re-assignments of external personnel (Chris T. and team) to Argo LiDAR development tasks as well as tapping expertise in other areas of Argo.

• Mark recognized the need to strengthen the team in areas of limited experience or capacity:  

   - The rotating LiDAR platform offers numerous benefits, but the existing team had limited experience with the multitude of issues associated with the transition of data, power and heat across a rotating boundary.  Augmentation of the LiDAR team with Chris Trowbridge and Bilge Kocer Yumer was a major win. 
  
   - There have also been significant additions to the team in the areas of: ROIC development, TPM, Device Foundries, DSP development, LiDAR test and Optical Engineering

• Mark has prioritized his schedule to regularly contribute to the design and fabrication planning of detector wafers.  The detector chip design group is capable, but the transition of the design from a back illuminated (BI) to a tight pitch front illuminated (FI) device structure is not a trivial exercise.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"_Some areas where I can grow and improve:_

1.  Want to be more engaged in company-wide strategy as well as week-to-week concerns of running the business, e.g., issues raised at Salesky Staff meetings

2.  More fully understand business model and how I can contribute to long-term company goals
- Also want to exploit opportunities for Argo LiDAR as a product where consistent with company's long-term goals (e.g., IPO)

3.  Want to engage more broadly across the organization
- Make sure I’m at other sites at least once per month; have been to all three sites, but not quite monthly
- Focus on meeting with larger number of members of other teams.  This has been very productive when I’ve done it (MI, MV) -- just do more.

_Some projects where I could have done better:_

1.  Planning of LiDAR development schedule was overly aggressive, particularly with respect to initial start-up
- Caused budget confusion because our initial plan assumed we would spend $0.5M before end of 2017; this didn’t happen, and our 2018 budget has this shortfall
- Also didn’t plan for capital budget, which will need to come out of initial 15 month LiDAR OpEx budget of $4.05M

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,manager,"Mark hit the high points on some of the things that could have gone faster.  But given the transition and everything else happening I don't have any squabbles so far w/ Mark's performance.  I think it's essential that we get to a point where all major decisions are locked in and the team knows what they need to build so that we can contain timing for the first lidar product.  Mark knows this, and I just want to see over the next few months, Mark working to eliminate any uncertainty and lock in the key decisions we need to make as fast as possible.",,,Bryan Salesky,bsalesky@argo.ai,Mark Itzler,mitzler@argo.ai,Hardware,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,report,"In systems meetings, we, as a team, often struggled with time management and delegation of tasks outside of the meeting room.  It is _great_ to go through each item step-by step and figure out our path forward together, but it is also a slow process that could be expedited by assigning tasks to team leads and then using meeting time to converge on new ideas that were developed independently (or within smaller focused groups).  This is much easier said than done.  Delegating tasks and defining interfaces is _hard_, but for us to maintain high efficiency productivity, it is essential to strive toward faster iteration time and less real-time large group decision making where possible.

Regularly scheduled one-on-ones are vital, even if brief.  I would prefer to have one-on-one meetings at least once every two weeks.  I know this is actively being worked, but it's an important change for the future.

Mark needs to be, and encourage others to be, _brutally_ honest about our strengths and weakness of both our team and our technology, to both ourselves and the broader scope of Argo teams.  It's important that _everyone_ understands both where we succeed and also where we fail.  Engineers who are made aware of technological issues and equipped with adequate data can provide valuable input to help develop solutions.  I think most (probably not all) of the weeds have been shaken out onto the table at this point in time, but there was a significant period of time early in development for which the broader Argo team didn't fully understand the degree to which we lacked certain engineering discipline areas of expertise (optical, mechanical, thermal, integration, etc...) and technological capability (resistance to optical overload) that are required for production level system design.  I'm not sure that Mark truly realizes the degree to which he is skilled at framing the context of an issue in a way that cloaks negativity and inspires confidence.  For marketing and sales -- this is a deeply valuable skill.  For discussion within internal engineering teams, the effects are insidious.  Engineers need to know the facts, through and through, with all the gory details included, if they have any hope of developing solutions to challenging problems.  

To operate effectively at his current level as the leader of lidar engineering, Mark needs to continue to expand his subject matter expertise of lidar systems development.  He is highly capable of learning vicariously through others shared experiences, but true wisdom and engineering intuition is difficult to obtain without hands on experience and equal measures of both real world success and failure.  This type of hands on experience will come in due time as we develop the first prototype and learn both the successes and many unforeseen shortcomings of the system design effort, but it will take time to absorb and grow from these experiences.  In the interim, it will be critical to continue to engage in regular technical discussions with people like Gary Kamerman, Jack, Igor, and myself to learn from our past experiences and understand more about our successes and especially failures in lidar system development at system, subsystem, and component level at both a macro and micro scale.

My preference would be to have weekly or at least every other week 1-on-1 meetings.  This would help me in my transition and growth in the TPM role and how I can best support LiDAR development.  

I believe more frequent (1x every 2 to 3 weeks) LiDAR all-hands meetings would be helpful.  Like Bryan does, Mark could provide verbal updates rather than needing to create lots of content.  Like the All-hands meeting, we could have special topics addressed by different members of the LiDAR team (e.g. Matt providing an overview of the ROIC design and schedule).

There will always be opportunities for growth and improvement at this level, and many people have many different ideas about the kinds of improvements warranted.

He carries a huge responsibility and workload, and is currently being spread far too thin.

Because of your present workload, I would recommend exploration of higher levels of qualified delegation and expansion of the org structure to include deeper and wider technical oversight of the development areas. (seasoned technical LiDAR architect [Gary Kamerman?], seasoned **technical** TPM?)
 
I would also recommend a more dynamic organization with periodic re-evaluation of structure and assignments to incorporate observations of critical areas and issues that develop during the program.  Changes could involve improved alignment of expertise and bolstering weak areas with new hires and/or reassignments. We have seen the LiDAR requirements shifting, and we have seen the hot-spots developing, we should be able to more readily adapt and optimize our structure.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"I would encourage Mark to find opportunities to expedite decision making on his team and to provide a clear hierarchy of decision making in his team. Argo Lidar spent longer finalizing high level design requirements, architecture, and specifications than anticipated, and it was not always clear who in Argo Lidar had the final say for design considerations. When it looks like engineering decisions are stagnating or not converging, I encourage Mark to weigh in with the deciding vote to push the team to move forward with a decision.

Argo Lidar has had some challenges with vendors including Moog. I would encourage Mark to identify and address problem vendors early. Sending his team to visit all key vendors in person would probably help weed out underperforming vendors, motivate vendors to give Argo Lidar top tier support, and build rapport with key partners. If vendor relationships still go bad, I encourage Mark to step in early with vendor management escalations, to dual source designs, and to cut habitually problematic vendors in a timely manner.

There were some early tensions between parts of the Argo Lidar team and parts of the Argo Hardware team. Mark did a nice job helping to mediate some of the conflict between Bilge’s team and Igor’s team. I encourage Mark to continue to avoid and address any future conflicts between Igor’s team and other counterparts throughout Argo.

I encourage Mark to push more information about Argo lidar to the rest of Argo through design reviews, status updates, or other information sharing. Argo Software and Argo Hardware do not hear much about the ongoing Argo lidar designs. Pushing information to the broader company will help Argo Lidar and the rest of Argo stay in sync.

As a manager he motivates and pushes his team in appropriate situations. He is instrumental in motivating the team to think ""out side of the process design box"" in regard to how the PDA design affects downstream processes. For example, he managed to make the team think through the process design and how it will affect packaging, wire bonding and downstream testing. As a result appropriate changes were made to the mask to accommodate wire bonding and array testing.
Mark recommended detailed team meetings,  process and design reviews, which resulted in in a better record keeping system that recorded all design and process changes, during the development stages.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"1. Proposed, designed and in the process of fabricating a new test platform that permits characterization of 1D FI GmAPD arrays prior to the delivery of the SRI 512x2 ROIC.  This platform will enable Argo to complete characterization of 2 iterations of FI devices in an arrayed format prior to integration of the Argo LiDAR.  It makes use of a Thru Glass Via (TGV) interposer to mate 1D arrays to a legacy 128x32 ROIC and camera electronics. TGV technology is new to the Argo NJ team, so the scope of this effort included significant technical research, vendor selection and detailed design.  Tight pitch of the FI arrays exceeded the TGV vendors fabrication capabilities, so I will leverage the capabilities of our legacy supply chain to complete Indium bump and hybridization of the TGV assemblies.

2. Maintained access to critical hybridization services after the vendor was sold to new owners with little interest to support legacy customers.  Equipment failure presented a new opportunity for the new owners to discontinue services, but negotiation with their business development lead secured a commitment for them to provide hybridization services for at least 2 more years.  The 2 year period is sufficient to satisfy Argo's LiDAR development needs and avoids a critical gap in the supply chain that could have complicated the sale of the GmAPD camera product lines.  Options for an alternative vendor were very limited and would have required significant materials, time and NRE to develop. 

3. Performed a detailed review of packaging formats and vendor capabilities to inform the selection of packaging format and vendor for development of the Rx module package.  Decision taken to proceed with a ceramic PGA package that will not meet longer-term cost targets, but which reduces the short-term execution and performance risks for 2018.  The draft design represents several significant departures from legacy formats to improve thermal performance and sensor location accuracy, while also reducing manufacturing costs.  Engaged with 2 capable suppliers to mitigate supply chain risks and to enable cost-competitive vendor selection.  Will kick-off development of a packaging solution that meets the longer-term cost goals when additional package design resources are available or after the short-term design activities are complete, whichever is sooner.

4. Managed the de-escalation of long-term tensions between 2 talented technicians.  Made it clear that complaints would be investigated without favoritism and that fomenting discord would not be tolerated.  It's still a work in progress, but I think the situation has improved significantly.  Wind down of the legacy business has created a new set of challenges to the integrity of the larger prototyping team.  I'll work with management to craft and execute solutions to these challenges.

His individual contributions to discussions regarding PDA design and fabrication are often complementary to those made by myself, Xudong, and Krys, regularly bringing up insightful concerns that may have gone unheeded otherwise. He laid the groundwork and provided the support I needed to organize daily PDA meetings, successfully managing multiple strong personalities and ultimately facilitating tapeout of the recent 2D and 1D PDAs. 

I’ve worked with Mark for almost four years now, and I believe I’ve seen marked growth since he became my direct manager after PLI’s acquisition. He’s long been known for vocally, strongly standing his ground when he disagrees with an opinion, and I know that’s rubbed some of my colleagues the wrong way over the years (I’ve never had an issue with this personally though – honest). While Mark certainly hasn’t changed his instinct to make his thoughts known in discussions, I believe he’s become more willing to leave the final call with his engineers when a good argument is presented in response, and more tactful in instances when he holds his ground. 

Mark is frequently supportive, and quick to provide feedback. He's generally very available to discuss issues one-on-one as they arrive, which is especially appreciated given his workload. I believe he has a good sense of when it's best to stay out of the way of personal conflicts and when to intervene, and I've found his judgement to be fair when he does.

Mark has developed a concept for early characterization of the new LiDAR APD arrays, using Through-Glass-Via technology to adapt the arrays to one of the legacy ROIC format.  (The new AL1 ROIC die will not be available until late 2018).  The TGV configuration has been designed and is currently in fab.   This work will enable early evaluation of several APD design variants that are currently in processing.

Earlier in the transition, Mark oversaw the APD device engineering, providing guidance and review of several APD array variants which are now in fabrication.

Throughout the transition, Mark has championed the maintenance of legacy processes and quality provisions, and relations with outside vendors critical to the coming prototyping and verification work.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,report,"My personal preferences for work lean towards exploration, research, and development, and this is can fall at odds with Mark’s sharp focus on production, reliability, and scalability. In all, this conflict does seem to balance out our approach to design and fabrication.  However, I do think that Mark ‘s strong drive to mitigate risk can manifest in unfruitful ways at times, especially in instances of phone calls with our PDA vendor (GCS). Though we’ve long had a difficult working relationship with them, we’ve had verbal communication breakdowns with them a couple times in the past six months that have been exacerbated by a conflict between Mark’s insistence on obtaining information from them and Peter’s unwillingness (or inability) to provide it. 

To be clear, I'm typically on board with Mark's opinion that we would benefit from the information he requests, and our responses from GCS are frequently unacceptable. Mark and I have discussed this in one-on-one meetings. However, I feel we need to reduce our reliance on obtaining process details over phone calls since they’ve proven ineffective many times over the past four years.  Peter prefers guessing at answers rather than admitting he's unsure, which fundamentally limits the potential scope of real-time communications.  

As of late, we’re still working out the best way to proceed. There seems to be a general consensus that streamlining communications through one person could help, as will ensuring we take the time to be as clarify our messages internally as much as possible prior to initiating conversations. I've taken on that role of ""point person"" with Mark's support, which has helped, but I still think we need to push harder on supporting John’s recent efforts to better detail all minute steps of our process prior to fabrication so that much of this becomes moot. 

This is absolutely a tough nut to crack, and many of these fixes are limited in their utility as long as GCS is refusing to be open with us. Peter can become standoffish out of frustration, GCS does not treat us as a high priority customer, and many people within Argo have different opinions about how we can improve communications. This is not Mark’s problem alone to fix. I bring it up here because this is the clearest issue our team has faced over the review period, and I believe it still needs further attention and support from management as a whole. Scheduling more frequent face time with the GCS team in Torrance could help, as could pushing GCS to provide a more competent technical point of contact (Dhiraj Kumar has recently come up as a potential new PoC with a stronger technical background than Peter).",,,Brian Piccione,bpiccione@argo.ai,Mark Owens,mowens@argo.ai,Hardware,

I need to recognize that the cadence of recruitment is very fast paced and that Slack is a very convenient and important tool for them.  Slack messages can be distracting at times, but they mean the recruiting team is working to help me.

2. I've long recognized the challenges associated with transitioning the Argo NJ team into a single team working to develop a single product, but I've come to recognized that the scope of our LiDAR effort requires further transition of myself from an individual contributor to a manager of contributors.  I enjoy the work, but continuing to cover the gaps in my team detracts from time better spent managing and growing my team members.  

  - I feel that I've done a decent job guiding the Detector Chip group into a more focused and detailed design approach and provided the space and support for Brian to assume a greater leadership role.  Brian's capabilities have allowed me to reduce my involvement in the daily work and to focus my attention in other areas.  Given the opportunity, I'm sure that Brian can assume a larger leadership role.

  - I also feel that I've done a good job supporting Junfu's interest and aptitude for simulation guided mechanical and thermal design.  Some areas of our prior development, such as the chip group, had incorporated simulation and modeling into their development, but other areas, such as mechanical design, had relied more upon experience and judgement.  I need to do a better job bringing attention to Junfu's work and to encourage his colleagues to make better use of the simulation tools we now have access to.

  - I need to do a better job guiding Ding in his transition from manufacturing engineer to a development engineer.  I've worked with him and steered a number of small projects to him that fit closely with his mechanical experience and aptitude.  Building on a series of small successes seems to be my best opportunity to engage his interest, overcome his lack of confidence and reverse his utter lack of urgency and great hesitation to take decisions.  I've engaged with People Operations for support and for help constructing a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP).  Win-Win scenario is to guide Ding into a more productive role, but I can't fail to take more definitive action when necessary.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"- Design

My first project at Argo was to develop the Triage web application. When I started, this application was a simple proof of concept node application. I drove the effort to transform this POC into a productized application, and did the majority of the implementation work. The code was decoupled into a React/Typescript front end application, and a Java back end server application. I influenced the design of the database schema, and wrote the majority of the queries. Along with the productization efforts I established multiple environments for the triage application, and incorporated secure secrets management. In March of this year, there was a pivot away from using the triage web application for displaying encoded videos, and towards VNC session generation. Within two weeks, I and a colleague had designed and implemented the changes needed for this pivot. We had worked out a communication protocol between the triage web app and the lambda infrastructure code, and I had designed and implemented the necessary changes in all layers of the triage web application. After the triage videos were deprecated, I replaced the videos with a map view. I was able to do this in one day by inspecting work that my colleagues had done on the Overwatch web app.

For the past month and a half, my primary focus has been designing and building out the Overwatch TaaS application, also referred to as OVDS. I played a large role in fleshing out what are the major components in this system, and how the major components of this system interact. Additionally, I have been designing and building the VDS communication server, also referred to as Viaduct. In order to drive the design of this component, I have reached out to members of the data core team to come up with a communication protocol. The priorities of this communication protocol are to be efficient in terms of size and speed, and fault tolerant, and bi-directional. I created a design, and implemented an initial version of this server, which meets all of these requirements ahead of the anticipated milestone timelines.

In addition to designing and building the Triage web application and Viaduct, I have advised on the designs of other projects. I had advised on a number of occasions for the Triage ETL pipeline. I helped to make a number of the database queries used by the ETL pipeline more efficient and more maintainable, by helping to construct queries which produced a more efficient execution plan, and reduced the need to flush partial data to disk. I advised two times on the design of the Jobs Platform. The first time I advised Shreyas, a senior engineer on the JP team, on the approaches which might yield scalable designs while using Postgres as a primary storage engine. The second time I advised Shreyas and Yan, another senior engineer on JP, on how to populate results from completed jobs, in ways that reduce total latency and network chattiness. In addition, I frequently advise my team members on Overwatch with topics including non-blocking io, data storage, batching techniques, asynchronous event processing, and pub-sub architectures.

- Implementation

To a large degree, the work that I have done on the Triage web application, the Overwatch design and the Viaduct design and implementation have been largely self directed. The following Triage features were suggested, designed and implemented by me with minimal oversight and managerial direction: rewrite to Typescript/Java, multiple environment support, and secure secrets management. The majority of user facing features did have managerial oversight and direction, but this was primarily geared towards defining the priorities for the respective features and managing the schedule when features were needed to land. In the effort to prioritize features, I assisted by providing an estimate of the effort and risk needed to deliver a user facing feature. To the best of my recollection, all of the features I had promised were delivered without significant schedule slippage.

My work on Overwatch to date has followed a pretty similar flow. The majority of my work on overwatch falls into two categories. The first is fleshing out the design of Overwatch, and specifically the communication protocol between Overwatch and the VDS, and the second is implementing Viaduct to execute the communication protocol. In order to drive the design of the communication protocol, I initiated contact with team members and leads of the LME team, the Vehicle core team and the Motion Planning team. I gathered information from these contacts and helped to push for the scheduling of meetings where decisions about the communication protocol and sequence diagrams would be finalized. Before finalizing all of the details of the communication, I began to implement the infrastructure needed to support such communication. This infrastructure builds a fabric for future communication using technologies which the Vehicle Core team is comfortable with using, and tying it together with the back end technologies needed by the rest of the Overwatch system. Additionally, I built a Viaduct client library so that Overwatch components can easily interface with Viaduct and send and receive messages from vehicles without handling all of the communication complexity. All of the work described here was largely self directed and self scheduled.

- Test
While I was building out the Triage web application, I made sure to consider and keep test coverage high. For the front end this entailed integrating the testing tools Jest and Enzyme in order to adequately test UI components and interactions. For the back end I implemented unit and functional tests to cover controllers and utilities. At the time of this writing the front end code has 87% statement test coverage, and the back end has 56% test coverage. If excluding SQL code, which is typically difficult to catch in unit tests, then the back end code has 74% test coverage.

- Impact & Output
While working on Triage, I came up with the strategy and approach for productizing the web stack. I came up with the proposal for how to accomplish this with minimal risk to the schedule, and helped to describe and assign the necessary work in order to deliver the new implementation within the allocated time.

I periodically worked directly with our customers, represented by Reuben Richmonds and Matt Priest, to prioritize and develop user features. This included creating an event export feature and a new approach to Triage navigation.

After starting to work on Overwatch, I started to design out the more intricate details of the infrastructure and the communication fabric. Based on this early design I discovered a number of potential issues with reliable communication, and came up with approaches to address them. One issue had to do with matching client calls from Ford with client calls from the VDS. I proposed to solve this problem by using Redis as a backplane. The other potential issue was with long duration rest calls. The approach I came up with for this was to use non-blocking io to serve rest calls, and for serving vehicle requests. Both of these approaches have been adopted and are being integrated into the Viaduct service and the Bart service. Additionally, I recognized some of the cross-system integration points which would be necessary for the overall design. Based on this recognition I reached out early to representatives of the external teams in order to accumulate information, and advised my team lead to schedule some of the meetings needed to finalize the necessary integrations.

I interfaced early with the readership review team. I became the first member of the offboard team to become an approved language reader. Since becoming a reader I have given advice and answered questions of my close team members that are looking into starting the process to get readership permissions.

While working on Triage I came up with a strategy for secure credential storage, using AWS KMS, and implemented this. Afterwords, I gave a talk to the LME team on how to take advantage of this in their services. I have also advised a member of the Performance Analysis team on how to use this.

- Expertise

I consider myself to be a generalist within the field of service programming, primarily back end and some front end. Additionally, I consider myself a specialist (with respect to a typical server side developer) in the areas of relational databases (Postgres, SQL Server), Pub/Sub architecture, non blocking io, and performance tuning/optimization. I have advised team members on all of these domains for a number of different projects, including Triage, JP and Overwatch. Additionally, since creating the Triage web application front end, I am seen in Mountain View as the local resource for front end design. I have strongly influenced the design of the Homer application, and have recently started to advise on a front end application which is being built out for JP.

- Judgement

Since starting at Argo I have made a number of recommendations which have influenced design decisions. This included the choice of pub/sub framework for the JP system. The team members were considering between using RabbitMQ and Redis for job distribution. I made an argument, with supporting evidence, that Redis was not the appropriate decision for the particular use case. In a number of other cases I delivered designs and implementations meeting the requirements for the respective use case, which is typically some combination of low risk, low maintenance, fast delivery, and stability. Examples of this include (described above) the Triage refactor, Triage multi-environment support, secrets management support, Triage VNC integrations, Viaduct internal/external communications designs, and non-blocking io for Viaduct & Bart.

During my time in designing the communication protocols and communication concerns between overwatch and the VDS I have been very proactive in reaching out to stakeholders in other teams. My primary mode of reaching out is Slack between individuals and impromptu zoom meetings. I believe I could have been more proactive in organizing broader meetings, and documenting all of the findings in the formal specifications.

But, occasionally his opinions and suggestions may not be in line with how the underlying problem needs to be approached. I feel that's mostly because he would not be aware of the entire background of the problem. So, spending more time listening will certainly help. But, I really hope he continues to share his thoughts and suggestions :)  

- Mark likes to move fast and sometimes may end up doing tasks which others in the team own.

One more nitpick I have is that Mark sometimes gives me an impression of stubbornness. From time to time, we spent too much extra time on a subject because we stuck in ""different version"" of how thing are. I do share half the responsibility here for not communicating the current status effectively.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Upon starting in January, I gathered existing information ROIC information and discussed ROIC requirements with Argo team, reviewed past PLI and competitor designs, wrote detailed specifications and requirements documents, reviewed them internally at Argo and with SRI to make sure all parties were clear on what was needed for the new ROIC and the tradeoffs are well understood, incorporated their feedback and finalized the requirements and specifications, then provided input to supply chain team regarding contract with SRI. To try to accelerate the SRI negotiations, I drafted SOW which was adopted by Argo and SRI. Provided technical support and input on fab costs and lead time during Argo-SRI negotiations. During this process I balanced technical goals with the development risks as they will impact overall Argo Lidar.

I developed a high level test plan, performed risk analysis for ROIC development program, applied results of risk analysis to improving clarity of requirements and specifying the deliverables and scope for SRI to cover identified issues. Began learning development tools and environments used at Argo including Xilinx Vivado and PyCharm and used these tools to begin development of ROIC test firmware in Verilog and Python.

Initiated and developed relationships with TowerJazz and On Semiconductor foundry and design groups and obtained and setup design kits to make Argo less dependent on external resources for ROIC design, fab, and testing. Identified design tools that may be needed for ROIC design and bring-up and coordinated plan for installation with IT and obtained preliminary cost information from Cadence.

I try to keep open collaboration with other Argo teams to make sure the ROIC development is well coordinated with other system components such as with receiver team on package and detector interfaces, with John on test resources for PDA and ROIC, and with Gennaro to make sure ROIC is compatible with FPGA interface and that design specs capture past lessons learned and evolving system requirements.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"I've only interacted with Matt since his onboarding in January, and we didn't have many opportunities to work together until February or so. Still, over the past few months, we’ve brought Matt into a few PDA meetings to discuss the interface with the ROIC, as well as the test capabilities he’s working to build up internally. He’s only been responsive and helpful. Matt’s substantial experience working with mask CAD vendors helped me navigate the acquisition of a new CAD package (L-Edit) as well.",,,Brian Piccione,bpiccione@argo.ai,Matthew O'Grady,mogrady@argo.ai,Hardware,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"- Matt has been a excellent addition to the Argo LiDAR team.  His domain knowledge with respect to ROIC design and CMOS fabrication have enabled him to rapidly review and digest the development history of the PLI GmAPD ROIC.  Integration of that  

- Matt's technical and relationship skills (and the automotive LiDAR business opportunity!) have positioned him to be more deeply integrated in the SRI design effort than prior design efforts have been.  (N.B. Management's decision to staff Matt's position has also enabled much greater opportunity to integrate with SRI than prior design efforts had.)  Tighter integration will enable more timely, detailed and effective reviews of SRI's development program.

- Matt did a good job supporting Supply Chain Management through a difficult vendor negotiation and onboarding process.  Detailed specifications and SOW and analysis of the foundry costs and schedule provided the Supply Chain Team with valuable technical support.

- Matt is highly organized and detailed in his work. ",,,Mark Owens,mowens@argo.ai,Matthew O'Grady,mogrady@argo.ai,Hardware,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Matt has been one of the most crucial hires since Argo acquired PLI.  As PLI we really struggled to hold our ROIC supplier accountable since we had no in house expertise in the area.  With the on-boarding of Matt that has all changed.  Matt has really been leading the way when it comes to interfacing with SRI and getting a design document and test plan going for the new ROIC.  I haven't known him long enough to know if he's improved at any of this but as a company we improved a ton just because of his presence.  I'm really looking forward to seeing what kind of product we can get out of SRI now that he is running the show on the ROIC procurement.  

In the time I've spent with Matt talking about the ROIC and some design trades I've learned a lot about the process of making the chip and tools necessary.  He's very easy to work with, and get along with, and it's going to be a fun time when we start getting chips in and integrate them into our FPGA firmware.  I look forward to working with him much more in the future.",,,Gennaro Salzano,gsalzano@argo.ai,Matthew O'Grady,mogrady@argo.ai,Hardware,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"I spent significant time starting relationships with vendors and setting up design kits and tools. My productivity should increase as these things are established and more focus can be on direct results. For example, I obtained foundry simulations models and wrote a script to format to use them in free simulator so in the future I can perform analysis of ROIC detector interface and other circuits quickly.

I’m working on improving my python coding to facilitate ROIC testing with high productivity and flexibility.

As ROIC development proceeds I'll host internal meetings more often to keep others up-to-date and aware of progress, open issues, and to share plans regarding testing and ROIC bring-up. ",,,Matthew O'Grady,mogrady@argo.ai,Matthew O'Grady,mogrady@argo.ai,Hardware,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Mat Priest is an absolute soldier. I have met very few people with the dedication and commitment to a company like Mat has. Whenever anything is asked of him, the answer is always “yes” and with a smile. He is willing to put in the hours and willing to come in at any time of the day/night/weekend to support testing or Engineering.  

He has done a great job of getting things stood up for data ingest both process and a tooling perspective. Brick/Data ingest is exponentially faster then just a couple of months ago. And with little notice he has done a commendable job with the triage team and is growing them into something more more meaningful every day. 

Matt has a great vision for some of the tools and the processes that we need to have to be successful and I hope to see those come to fruition.",,,Rob Vaniglia,rvaniglia@argo.ai,Matthew Priest,mpriest@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"**Data Ingest, Brick Handling**
- Took ownership of the vehicle operations data ingest process for the Pittsburgh Depot. Reviewed existing documentation and updated local procedures to ensure data was tracked from collection to digital archive, minimizing lost data.
- Inventoried Pittsburgh data bricks and fleet related solid state drives (SSDs). Provided accountability of devices of significant value, while also ensuring availability to three locations. This minimized the risk of decreased vehicle utilization due to brick availability.
- Worked with software developer on the improvement of data ingest speed and accountability of data. Provided existing workflow and expectations to transition the process from a very time consuming and manual process, to one that is more automated and user friendly.
- Collaborated with Dearborn location on ingest procedures. Standardized procedures across two locations, which then provided the template for two more ingest sites (New Stanton and Miami), and others going forward.
- Converted several existing Pittsburgh four-drive SSD bricks into two and three drive versions. The addition of nearly 11 bricks provided a nearly 30% increase in mission capacity, reducing the number of bricks tied up ingesting small amounts of data.
- During critical initial mapping for Miami operations, worked with remote team to ship data bricks back and forth to Pittsburgh in the absence of a high speed data line. This ensured that data was available to the mapping team, turning a possible 3-4 day process into one that only took two.

**Fleet Laptop Setup**
-  Took over “Swan Server” fleet laptop setup process for Pittsburgh. Setup physical server cart to include network and power cable routing, and established start and end of day procedure for vehicle operators to follow. This minimized misplaced laptops, and ensured that they were readily available for short notice laptop updates. It also reduced laptop setup wait times, allowing operators to get on task more efficiently. 
- Worked with original process designer and new process owner to improve dependability and efficiency of the overall laptop setup process.

**Triage Ops**
- Worked to transition triage operations over from a largely conceptual team to one that works more closely with vehicle operations.
- Carried over initial managers vision and design progress over to a working prototype and eventual formal tool for review and management of incoming fleet operations intervention comments.
- Expanded and established general day to day workflow to include Confluence wiki setup containing expectations and reference material for triage operators, as well as archiving of daily and weekly triage status reports.
- Worked closely with developer to test and implement new “VNC pipeline” method for reviewing vehicle logs, more closely resembling the in-vehicle ability to manipulate sensor data to assess takeover and issues coming from fleet operations public facing vehicle testing
- Encouraged one of the triage operators (Charles Gelso) to explore his interest and experience in data analysis and .sql programming. His outstanding work led to the automation of several manually performed daily triage reporting tasks, and also led to his assistance with automating vehicle reliability tracking, as well as tools to assist shift leads with daily management and reporting tasks.",,,Matthew Priest,mpriest@argo.ai,Matthew Priest,mpriest@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,manager,,,,Tony Warywoda,twarywoda@argo.ai,Matthew Priest,mpriest@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Since coming onto Argo Mat has made a huge impact in the Operations organization. He was immediately able to get up to speed on deploying to fleet laptops and handling the ingest process very quickly. He has been able to manage the process and teach the rest of the new shift leads that have come on after him how to handle that process. He was also willing to put in those long hours when he first hired on to learn those processes and make sure everything was getting done in a timely manner. He would make sure he was at the depot by 7am to start getting the fleet laptops ready for the next day and then he would stay (without complaining) until 8, 9, 10 pm at times to make sure all the tests were completed and making sure all of the bricks had started ingesting.

Mat has also taken on the challenge of starting up our Triage Team, hiring team members, and training them on the tools to make triage happen.  With his team Matt has also created a ton of Metabase dash boards and the triage app to help with log replay and downloadit links for us to add to tickets and for the engineers to use quickly.

Mat has also been a big part of helping to build the ops culture at the depot. He brings positive energy and enthusiasm every day and everyone else around him can sense that. He is very knowledgeable about the industry in general and how the technology works which he readily shares with the VOs at the depot making their knowledge base much stronger helping them learn and grow in their position. Its great for the VOs to be able to directly interface with the triage team so they can get direct feedback on their tags to make them better operators in the vehicles.",,,Mike Vernau,mvernau@argo.ai,Matthew Priest,mpriest@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Mat basically spun up a TriageOps team in a week. When reviewing emails, I found one where he sent out his first email with Dashboard statistics.  In the email thread I literally responded by saying ""_Pretty impressive to think that TriageOps didn't even exist a week ago and this is the progress you all have enabled via your hard work and vision._"".  Mat was able to accomplish in one week, what a whole team struggled to accomplish in many months. He has slowly built a small team that is capable of digesting the data from 3 whole cities.

Mat was the main PoC for ingest for many months until Ryan started taking over some of the responsibilities.  This was critical to ensuring operations continued on without being held back by an insufficient number of bricks.  After each new update to the ingest procedure, he would send out an email update to the team to notify us of the changes.  Mat values intra-team communication and is always quick to pass information to others. 

Part of Mat's initial responsibilities included getting the proper software and maps on the laptops.  This is still a responsibility he carries today.  He always tries to be proactive in ensuring that the vehicles are setup with the proper release and map. Even though our current process is less than ideal, he performs this job with great pride.  

Mat is probably the most admired and respected person in the operation.  Peers, VO's, and VO I's marvel at his work ethic, knowledge, vision, and character.  He is probably the most impactful person in the org because of the way he always leads by example.  He never cuts corners, always gives 110%, never complains, and always strives to get the best out of others.",,,Brandon Duncan,bduncan@argo.ai,Matthew Priest,mpriest@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"My only suggestion to Mat is to have the confidence to be honest when things are not as they should be. As stated earlier he has an amazing amount of experience in this field and has had a first hand look at what works and what doesn’t work. I have had countless conversations with him and he has legitimate concerns and suggestions about some of our processes and tooling, and has a great vision for how things could be. I would like to see Matt be more assertive and communicate those suggestions and concerns to the appropriate people to get the proper traction. 

I feel there is a good correlation in what Mat and I do, and I would love to have the opportunity to work closer and be brought into more conversation with regards to tooling and process planning to support Mat and his efforts for the larger Team.",,,Rob Vaniglia,rvaniglia@argo.ai,Matthew Priest,mpriest@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Matts communication is one thing he could focus on improving going forward. Matt is a pretty reserved individual so when he first started he would normally just struggle trying to figure out issues by himself instead of raising the issue to the proper channels and getting some help addressing any of the issues he was seeing.  One example of this (even though it speaks to his work ethic) was coming in super early to setup fleet laptops or staying super late to get bricks ingested instead of raising these issues up and getting some more help sooner so he didn't have to live in the ingest room at the depot.

He could also be better at sending out emails to the ops team so we have a better idea and explanation of all the tools, dashboards, and metabases his team has created.

One other specific instance that I can think of just very recently is that he could have helped to ensure Mark Dunkerly had his deployment laptop setup before going down to Miami with it since he has a vast knowledge of the deployment process and it does take some time to actually get the computer setup. Mark did only get the computer a few days before hand and may have not mentioned it to Matt but it would have been good to get him some help while he was in Pittsburgh with the large supporting team around him.",,,Mike Vernau,mvernau@argo.ai,Matthew Priest,mpriest@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"First and foremost Mat needs to take a company sanctioned 1-2 week vacation.  He has spent a years worth of hours at work already in 2018. Mat has a bad habit of trying to put the weight of the world on his back, and instead of just asking for help or pushing to have a process be more automated or efficient, he puts in long hours to get the work done.  Mat is respected by everyone that crosses his path, and people would listen if he was just a little more assertive in making demands.  A perfect example of this is the unscalable method we currently have for getting SW releases on laptops.  Mat has great vision and knowledge and would be able to propose a common sense solution to make the current process scaleable.

I look forward to Mat getting a little more help on his team.  I know if he is able to delegate more to his other team members, we can start to utilize the close relationship of TriageOps and FleetOps to our advantage.  They are the overseers of all the data that is being annotated. In the future it would be great if we can get into a regular cadence of Triage providing FleetOps with unique situations that they see when reviewing footage and clips.  Those clips can help to make the VO's even more prepared and knowledgeable.  ",,,Brandon Duncan,bduncan@argo.ai,Matthew Priest,mpriest@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"**Growth and Improvement:**
- Work to transition more of the manual daily/weekly triage tasks to more automated processes.
- Delegate more of the daily tasks so that I can focus on the broader awareness of patterns and trends across Pittsburgh, as well as across other cities.
- Consider more long-range planning for data ingest and triage analysis, to ensure that we are ahead of any operations growth to prevent delays in triaging/reporting.

**Projects where I could have done better**
- I should have passed the increasing data ingest chokepoints up sooner, rather than attempt to manage them myself by extending my workday and coming in after hours.
- I should have completed the brick inventory sooner, and expected more accountability from external sites (Dearborn at the time).
- For laptop setup, I should have reached out to others within vehicle operations to ensure that others beyond myself and Mike Vernau have the ability to pull down and push software and maps to the laptops in case either of us are out of office or otherwise unavailable.",,,Matthew Priest,mpriest@argo.ai,Matthew Priest,mpriest@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"During this quarter I was able to bring myself up to speed on our integration process, work myself into the daily operations routine, assist in landing software changes to the fleet and worked towards preparations for Z1.  In late January/early February I discovered a defect in our networking of the Applanix IMU and was able to assess the damage to the affected cables.  In doing so I came up with a preventative solution that is still being utilized on all Applanix vehicles, and since then we have seen no issues with those Applanix units. In this I was able to establish my relationship with Joe and his team, grow familiar with our team and their abilities, and to see through my first of many fleetwide changes.   

I've worked closely with several members of the Vehicle Infrastructure team to gain an understanding of their test needs to help maximize fleet usage, as well as to engage in improving their on-vehicle test robustness.  The first Infrastructure VMR I helped move through was the “OS Kernel and NVIDIA Driver Update” wherein I worked closely with the requesting developer to validate their work in-Depot.  Building off of this relationship with the developer, I was able to assist the ""OS core file dump"" to understand the operations needs of the fleet and to minimize the number of days a vehicle would be down for strictly in-depot developer testing.  I created the documentation, rolled it out to the technicians  and worked closely with Bryan and  Alan to get this updated across the fleet.  I’ve helped work through the fleet update to the  PSCM and MABX, and in doing so I’ve learned to use the DPSACE software which has  assisted me in troubleshooting issues, a tool that I am the only person in Pittsburgh currently able to utilize.  One VMR that has been worked on since I’ve started is the update to an Argo-created operating system for Percy and  HC1&2, CarOS.  Working with Arsenii, the developer, I closely supported him during his development phase in the Depot.  In doing so, I became familiar with the proposed changes, our current system, and how each node fits together as a system. Before pushing such a large change with so many potentially unforeseen consequences, Arsenii and I developed a robust test strategy.  This was to go over all interested stakeholders and to have test data ready for all parties before questions were asked about the update.  I created the documentation on how to update, gave Arsenii feedback on how to best design an update process for Ops, and supported remotely the update across the fleet, utilizing other integration engineers and vehicle operators to get our fleet on one standard.  

One subsystem that has been a theme of throughout my first months  has  been the Halo Creek system.  When I first started we did not have a fleet at operational parity across platforms, as some units  were still missing GPU upgrades.  Working with Bryan Barnette and Joe Serbin’s team, I was able to integrate the first units to arrive in Pittsburgh, commission them, and send other  units  back to Kontron in order for us to have a complete fleet.  When software engineers  noticed performance degradation correlated to thermal events on certain vehicles, I led the charge to quantify how many units  were  affected.  In doing so, I worked with Infrastructure teams to request tools necessary to diagnose the issue, our computer engineers to understand  how the failure could have happened, and our thermal team to review  designs, understand  manufacturing processes, and review information for Z1 and beyond.  While this is still an ongoing investigation with no clear end in sight, I am leading daily meetings with the  supplier Kontron to hold them accountable and  keep them from making short-sighted mistakes that would lead to a similar rework event in the near future.  During this  time I have taken to acceptance testing and integrating all reworked units  back into our  fleet to ensure the quickest turnaround  time to an otherwise  painful process.  

In preparing for Z1, I work with members of our compute hardware team and members of other hardware subsystems to drive development progress in preparation for the build.  I have coordinated with a cross-functional team to document trunk humidity concerns to Ford through instrumenting a fleet-vehicle and interpreting results.  This  data was useful to our thermal team when the Halo Creek thermal issue was discovered as  well.  I also continue to attend build design meetings with the goal of improving performance from an operations perspective, most recently suggesting a change to our Z1 data logger to make the device hand-securable.  

I've also been able to assist daily operations through working closely with Vehicle Ops and Reliability to assist the fleet on a daily basis.  Each morning and when issues pop up in the day, I work to mitigate hardware issues and to document and track these issues.  Once a pattern emerges I work closely with Shift Leads to help them in triaging problems in the future.  One example of this is in the ""shaking LiDAR"" Argonaut issue, where an imperfect PCAN contact manifests as shaking LiDAR.  Since this has been discovered, I worked to educate the VOs to be able to identify it quickly and relay this information back to me to get the fleet back on the road. Another example of  my being able to understand issues in the field was when there was a battery drain event in Miami that led to a laptop dying while on-mission.  Aggregating private  slack conversations, experiential knowledge, and messages as reported by operators in real-time, I was  able to report the issue in a concise way in Jira, establishing a timeline of events  that efficiently diagnosed a hardware failure in Miami as I was in our Pittsburgh Depot. This would not have been possible had I not been monitoring the argoai-drivers Slack. I work closely with our Pittsburgh SVOs to help give them the knowledge to do their jobs better, frequently give Tech Talk Thursdays to our operators to keep them engaged with the technology, and  have bi-weekly meetings with our Argo shift leads in Miami to answer any questions they have about Argonaut to allow them to succeed.

I also work towards improving company-wide awareness of the vehicle system through routine vehicle level tours to leadership and engineers to give coworkers an understanding of our current capabilities.  I have done this for members of the TPM team, our labeling and mapping team, our thermal team, and our own vehicle operators, and the RAD team, tailoring each presentation to highlight the impact of certain hardware subsystems to each particular audience's needs. A goal for the next quarter is to work with People Ops to develop a  presentation similar to this into onboarding for all engineering levels.  I also work closely with tech here in Pittsburgh to bring their computer system literacy up through article sharing, documentation, and experimentation with several Linux command tutorial books checked out at the local library.

In conclusion, I believe that in my time at Argo I  have become knowledgeable  of all of our subsystems and am on my way to becoming an expert in our compute system.  I have grown my understanding  of the platform through continuous inter-department communication with members  of the hardware and  software teams  that I take to improve my documentation of vehicle changes and  operations that I then distribute to Operations team members.  I have been continuously engaged in our Z1 build while acting as a contributor to our fleetwide quarter  goal of 100k autonomous miles.  I have enjoyed working with members of the engineering team from every corner of the company and hope to continue learning about our complex system from every area of the team.  I would like to continue my training of members of the Operations team, and would like to take on an increasing involvement as a mentor as Argo continues to grow.

- Halocreek acceptance testing
- I also worked with Matt on the Halcoreek temperature humidity study. 
- Dumping knowledge onto the technicians: Currently, our technicians are rotating between locations and when one gets to the Dearborn location, I do not really have to show them too many things, as Matt has already taught them most of the things that I would have. 
- Interfacing with multiple functional groups to get processes in place and to debug certain issues. 

In general, I have watched Matt's knowledge of the Z0 Fleet vehicles grow from his first day here. He is now a great troubleshooter. It will be interesting to see how things go when we get to z1. The vehicle integration team will be starting from a clean slate as far as hardware goes.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Matt has been an excellent asset to the Ops team from the get-go and continues to improve as his experience grows. 

I have worked directly with Matt during our (seemingly constant) issues with Halo Creek units in Z0, namely humidity concerns and CPU overheat issues. One of the best things about how Matt handles these investigations is that he is very organized when laying out test procedures, and keeps all results in a clear and concise manner. 

Matt has learned a ton about Linux environments since starting at Argo, and it's great to have the ability to be less verbose when describing tests to him, yet still receive correct results. 

I am excited to see what he brings to the table during the Z1 build and integration process, and happy to be able to work with him through the inevitable issues we find.",,,Brian Margosian,bmargosian@argo.ai,Matthew Puchalski,mpuchalski@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,

Shift leads in Pittsburgh know when to escalate issues to the hardware integration team and I would like to keep my level of vehicle awareness as we ramp up in Miami and other future sites.  I need to improve my ability to interpret VO described vehicle behavior over Slack and need to develop continued effective communication to onsite Integration and Service Ops representatives.  I would  also like to continue to be mindful of my time management as I grow in my responsibilities. Currently, as the largest portion of the fleet is located in Pittsburgh, it is possible for me to come in during the weekend to help bring cars back to being ok to run a mission, but I know the days are numbered that I am able to do that and must rely on efficient communication with others across sites.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Matt joined Argo/the MAPTOOLS team in January earlier this year. In that time, he began his journey here acclimating to our codebase, tools, and libraries that we use for development.  If I recall correctly he was previously working in the ES5/ES6 & AngularJS world before Argo.  In that time, he's ramped up on React, Redux (our state management library), TypeScript, and Jest & Enzyme (testing libraries), and isn't hesitant to ask questions when he isn't sure of something.  

Matt's first contributions included feature improvements and bug fixes for some of the tools that we already had in place.  He was able to successfully ramp up on these tools in order to begin to deliver features that benefitted the LMP team and their ability to create maps.

One of the more major projects that Matt had undertaken was the creation of ArgoView, a tool that allows the user to see what the AV saw with a 360 degree field of view.  This project seemed well paired with other development experiences, as he seemed to know just what to do to stitch the images together.  From my perspective, ArgoView has been a _huge_ win for LMP, as they can see the exact condition of the road at the time of log creation, which cuts out a degree of uncertainty when attempting to performing mapping activities.  ",,,Ryan Waskiewicz,rwaskiewicz@argo.ai,Matt Mahan,mmahan@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Since being hired in January, I've accomplished the following:

Created a new application called Argo-View. This application is a 360 degree visualization tool to allow the LMP team the ability to see what the AV saw at a given location. This has been integrated into daily use and has become an integral part in helping to clarify questions when other maps are out of date and we are mapping an area that is not local. With the ability to view multiple logs and seeing what has changed, this has allowed LMP to see what construction seems to be temporary and should map those areas, or what construction seem more long term and should not be mapped at this time. Along with this, the ability to view what signs and pavement marking look like, has allowed for enhanced capability to correctly map lanes, and their specific traffic directions related to them. This helps ensure the AV obeys the laws and provides clarity when mapping out of state areas that have different regulations.

Developed a new review/QA application called the Signal Face Reviewer at the request of Pete. This application allows Signal Faces to be seen how the AV would see them. This allows for verification of the correct location without having to go do a test run/drive with the AV. This application was created and used to help the Pittsburgh demo locate and view offset and missing traffic lights. It helped to detect a double wall issue and show other Signal Faces very high up in the air. This application will eventually be added to the map creation pipeline, but currently is being used within the Map-Tools team to help with verification.

Created Read Only modes for most of the Map-Tools applications. This will ensure no data is accidentally updated when being viewed. This also allows for access to the Map-Tools for other teams to view the data. Along with this a new Selection Tool, that allows any of the map objects to be selected and viewed.

Added improvements to the Lane Conflict tool to make it more user friendly. Added additional navigational features and added the ability to see what Conflict number you are on.

Also added several usability features to our Lane Editor tool including filtering by attributes and zoom to mouse pointer. These features help to increase usability and allow for better review of the currently mapped out parcel. 

Worked with the LMP team along with Jess, Patrick, and Meredith to identify issues and potential problems with Map-Tool applications and how to resolve them. Specifically this included times when applications failed to save data or threw an error while trying to save. Working alongside LMP to quickly get them back up and running. Along with fixing issues reported, taking suggestions and watching how LMP preforms tasks has enabled features and enhancements to be made to help simplify and speed up map production. This included items such as setting the hasTrafficControl flag on Sign or Set association to allow one less checkbox to be clicked on each lane segment. 

Since joining the team, I've learned several new technologies including React, Jest, Git, and npm. These technologies are now used on a daily basis.

Currently in the process of shadowing interviews to become an interviewer.",,,Matt Mahan,mmahan@argo.ai,Matt Mahan,mmahan@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,manager,,,,Dan Fitzpatrick,dfitzpatrick@argo.ai,Matt Mahan,mmahan@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Matt has been a great addition to the Map Tools development team since he started in January.  Despite a steep learning curve on our tools and development environment, Matt hit the ground running with enhancements to the map tools.  His implementation of filtering of lanes based on properties was a huge help to the operations team, allowing for much finer control of editing and reviewing in the Lane Editor.

Matt's implementation of the Argo View tool is, in my opinion, his biggest accomplishment at Argo since he started.  Now that the LMP team is mapping in multiple cities, it is necessary for them to be able to establish ground truth while performing the mapping task.  Argo View allows our operators to quickly and efficiently see what the Argo AV saw when it went through an area.  A particularly thoughtful feature of the tool is the ability to switch between logs (if multiple are available), in case one log is corrupt or has bad imagery.

Matt was also a huge help during the traffic light crisis leading up to the March 29 Pittsburgh demo ride.  He quickly implemented a review tool to verify the position of traffic signal faces as they were projected into the map.  His tool was able to surface many problems with the signal face projection, so that the team could move forward on fixes to the traffic signal positions.  The tool saves valuable time in allowing us to reposition traffic lights before taking the map on car, which reduces the number of iterations required to get a map right.

Matt is a highly motivated worker, and attacks his work with enthusiasm.  Whether he is working alone on a tool, or on punch list enhancements, Matt provides consistent, high quality output.  He fits in well with the rest of the team, as well as with the LMP team members.  Matt is always available to answer questions from LMP members, as well as from myself and Jessica.

I have been consistently impressed by Matt's ability to learn and master new technology.  As he noted in his self-review, he did not have direct experience with several of the development technologies used here at Argo.  You would never know that now, 4 months in to his employment here.  He is a quick learner, and an incredibly important member of the development team.",,,Patrick Gray,pgray@argo.ai,Matt Mahan,mmahan@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Matt joined the team at the beginning of this year.  Since joining he has:

* Spearheaded the development of the SignalFace Reviewer application.  This application was necessary to perform validation of the signal faces that are ingested through a variety of means.  Once he completed this, he was able to add additional features to it, such as the ability to edit the signal faces, the ability to view multiple logs, and the ability to view lane geometry.  All of these changes improved the ability to validate the signal face positions and allowed us to get a map that was necessary for the Ford demo in March.

* Created a tool similar to Street view that is used for calling up logs of a specific location in a map.  This tool has been invaluable to the mapping production team in determining differences tied to a specific section of roadway.  This application has been the single largest ask from the production team since we've started, and it has made a substantial impact in the results coming from the production team.

* Added several usability features to several of the LME applications, including readonly modes so that content can be shared throughout the organization, tool improvements to increase the speed of the LMP operators, and UI improvements to aid in debugging and ease of use for the users.

* Matt has also greatly contributed to peer reviewing pull requests and has become very helpful in his comments and has improved code quality and thoroughness. ",,,Brad Krupa,bkrupa@argo.ai,Matt Mahan,mmahan@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Matt has been a great addition to the map tools team. He has helped the team land new tools as well as enhance existing tools. He has been very helpful with triaging issues with the LMP team as well.

Matt works well with the team. He is always looking to bounce ideas off of other team members while he is working on a project to make sure that he is creating something worthwhile. He takes feedback into consideration and improves as he goes. Because of this, Matt's projects have been very successful. ",,,Jessica Hulings,jhulings@argo.ai,Matt Mahan,mmahan@argo.ai,Software,

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"In coming to Argo, Matt has taken up learning quite a few technologies that we use in our day to day development. One of the technologies I'd like to see him ramp up in is git usage, particularly in terms of reviewing.  During the creation of ArgoView, the initial commit was rather large in size.  Matt was successfully able to split it up, but on a file-by-file basis.  This made review of the tool difficult, as there would be unused variables, methods, etc. that would eventually get used 'down the line' in a future commit in the chain.  Since then he has been better about git commits and splitting them up as features are introduced, but I would love to see this put into action for his next big project.

Another aspect I would love to see Matt grow in is as a code reviewer.  There have been a few times now where I've gone to review a PR that he's approved and found errors that could have been caught earlier in the review process.  That is _not_ to say I/we should expect anyone to catch every nit/typo/what have you. Moving forward, I would like to see Matt apply the same rigor to reading PRs that he applies to his PR authorship (ideally getting him prepared to become a reader sometime this year).",,,Ryan Waskiewicz,rwaskiewicz@argo.ai,Matt Mahan,mmahan@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Not being a developer myself, I can't speak to the quality of Matt's code.  The volume and consistency of his work speaks for itself, however.  Personally, I would like to see Matt speak up more confidently in meetings.  His input is often very thoughtful, and always appreciated, but sometimes it feels like he is holding back.  Matt is a very talented developer, and he should always take the opportunity to promote his ideas and opinions in development meetings.",,,Patrick Gray,pgray@argo.ai,Matt Mahan,mmahan@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Matt should continue to work on his familiarity with the particular tech stack that we use.  His inexperience with GIT, npm, and react will continue to improve and should be a point of emphasis for him going forward.  Additionally, Matt can continue to improve his understanding of typescript and learn to leverage some of the advanced features of the language.

Testing is quickly becoming one of the most important parts of the LME applications, and Matt continuing to recognize where and when to add testing, as well as learning ow to best leverage jest to build unit tests will greatly benefit him in the future.",,,Brad Krupa,bkrupa@argo.ai,Matt Mahan,mmahan@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"An area I would like to grow in is with using Jest as a testing platform. This is an area that is beneficial to our code base that I still do not feel completely comfortable with. Since learning Jest in January, I am able to write tests and be able to cover multiple scenarios, but it still does not come natural to me and often is harder to write the tests then it is to make the change. I feel that learning this and becoming more proficient in writing tests would help speed up development time for me and also add benefit to my team. 

Another area of improvement that I can focus on is learning the different process and pipeline that are used throughout our Production process. Over the last few months I have learned a lot about our logs, their content, and have used them in several applications. Learning about the ingestion/extraction process I think would help my understanding of other application within our Team and also allow for additional knowledge of how our Team as a whole works.",,,Matt Mahan,mmahan@argo.ai,Matt Mahan,mmahan@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,I will piggyback on what Matt said in his self-review and say that he could grow in the area of learning more about the entire map production process. This is something that comes with time and experience. I believe it will help him interact/support the LMP team more effectively when he gets pulled into that and also help understand how the map tools fit in to the production process. ,,,Jessica Hulings,jhulings@argo.ai,Matt Mahan,mmahan@argo.ai,Software,

I think we've made great progress this year w/ team meetings, our weekly updates, Systems PAT charter, Systems TPM and JAMA to help the team know what each other is working on and what the priorities are. 

Having said that, we are still getting tasks coming in that take time away from the plans (aka bugs). The latest examples of these are the Argo impact to the plant, Z0 power consumption and data logging requests from Ford. All need to be done, but potentially cause delays in other high priority tasks. I totally understand the challenge and only potential idea would be when a request comes in if we should push harder for priority and timing from Ford and/or let them know what may get done later to do the new task. Building the team as noted above will also hopefully relieve some of these bandwidth constraints.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"**Areas to improve on**
- I'm slow to close out projects and initiatives. Often projects my team works on are prioritized to support a specific effort another team is leading. When the project we're supporting gets the input they need, I've been slow to call a review and close out our effort until it needs to be reopened
- I've been slow to institute basic project management structure. I don't intuitively crave that kind of structure as someone working on a team, but, for example, getting a Jira dashboard to track incoming work requests from FMC has been a huge help to the team. Lesson learned there.
- I need to be even more proactive. I've had my initiatives, and have supported other initiatives. However, I think I've been a bit too reactive to major things that need to be addressed. This has resulted in poor prioritization of work at times, and rushed schedules.
- I need to evangelize even more. Many of the efforts the systems team is working on are very cross-cutting and very forward-looking. Without the buy-in the whole team, we won't be successful. This won't end, and it falls to me to blaze that trail for my team.


**Projects where I could have done better**
- Have not had the impact on software that I would have liked. It might be argued that it's still too early to push on software yet, but I think I could have done more to integrate my team into the software teams efforts.

- While on paternity leave, I did not set a strong enough plan for a newly hired team. Our efforts got off the rails in a number of ways and we had to take major corrective action.

For example:
- system, latencies and bounding scenarios. Both our teams should be hand in hand and be able to determine what are our constraints. We are at the final stage for the design (z2) and we still don't have clear system constraints: ie. we observe a 32ms frame transfer delay on GMSL, is it a risk for the safety?  I am faced with those kind of questions today and I still can't answer them.

- safety: there is still a lot of work to do. Today I can't still answer basic questions like which ASIL I really need on pegasus, what are the options if we force Linux on pegasus? Are NN and ASIL-D really incompatible? Those have huge impacts on designs we are currently freezing for good on z2!

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"My first month or so at Argo was dominated by the Pittsburgh demo on March 29.  I came in and immediately had to learn the technology, terminology, team(s), and processes.  I jumped right in and took it all on, coming in with my team on the weekend, staying late to write release notes and wait for publishes, setting overnight alarms to check on the status of map releases and send necessary communication to the organization.  Somehow, we did it.  Despite the rain, the March 29 demo went off without a hitch.

Additionally, we're now up to publishing as many as 6 maps per week, some of which are new areas and some of which are edits to existing maps.  From what I understand, the LMP team was never previously working on more than one map at a time.  Managing the simultaneous production of up to 4 map locations with several sections, or one large map with edits, requires organization and communication across the organization.  

I've also developed great, open relationships my team.  They're honest with me; they trust me; and they're willing to go the extra mile for each other.  It's important to me that they understand that they're part of a team, and that what they're doing is vital to the organization's success.  

I hope that I'm also developing a good rapport with the labeling and mapping engineering side of the organization.  I have a weekly meeting with Dan to go over my team's challenges with the tools; we work together to ensure that they're prioritized and understood correctly, leading, hopefully, to incremental improvements and a decrease in map production time.

Coming from a completely different industry was initially challenging for me, but I hope I've learned quickly enough to now be an asset.  I understand, to the best of my ability, the technical ins and outs of the map production process.  I work very, very closely with the maprep team on getting work out the door, and they've been kind enough to make technical improvements to their systems to help accommodate the organization's needs.",,,Meredith Whitney,mwhitney@argo.ai,Meredith Whitney,mwhitney@argo.ai,Software,

They were in need of leader and she has provided them with that. She has regular one-on-one's with them, got them rides in the AV, given them more responsibility; giving them a better sense of how they fit in at Argo. She has also given them a voice on the LME team and works with Dan to make sure their requests and needs are being addressed. She has also done a great job of planning and organizing the work of the LMP team. The amount of documentation and JIRA ticket traceability that we have greatly increased because of Meredith. 

Meredith is dedicated to her job and has put a lot of extra hours in in order to complete projects on time. She worked very hard to learn and understand the processes and the teams in such a short time. ",,,Jessica Hulings,jhulings@argo.ai,Meredith Whitney,mwhitney@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Meredith has done an incredible job. She is working what I consider to be two full-time jobs: leading and managing the LMP production team, and coordinating and directing the overall map production process (filing and tracking collections, directing log processing and base map builds, and scheduling and leading the vector map work, as well as driving QA). And she also does some things with labeling that I don't know as much about.

She has a heartbreaking dedication to her work, puts in far too many hours, and delivers a huge amount of results.

She's taken on a great deal of communication work: She produced a substantial series of map production plans and schedules, iterating with leadership to try to understand both a format and a content that were acceptable to their not-always-stable priorities. She presents mapping status in autonomy integration on a regular basis, representing Tyler's entire department.

The map production process is in a more stable, more measured, and more planned state since she took it over. There's plenty more for all of us to do, but this is definite progress.",,,Seth Porter,symmetry@argo.ai,Meredith Whitney,mwhitney@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Meredith is the best all around Map Production lead that I've worked with. She came into an extremely fast-paced environment where the expectations for output are absurdly high and has been able to ensure that LMP has produced the maps and labels the org needs. She is dedicated to ensuring the success of her team, there have been multiple instances where I came in on a Saturday morning only to find that she was already there along with one of the LMP operators pushing to unblock an autonomy effort.

She has also been instrumental in developing our tooling, her efforts in documenting and raising issues and requests for improvements have made it so that we can tackle real problems that LMP is facing and the footwork on defining the problem has already been completed. For example, Meredith created a comprehensive document stating the issues that she had identified with our existing Operator Management tooling along with the information necessary for us to move forward with creating solutions such as prioritization and expected impacts.",,,Eddie Jones,ejones@argo.ai,Meredith Whitney,mwhitney@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Meredith is one of the hardest working people I have ever met in my life. She hit the ground running as soon as she started and has not stopped sprinting since. Her communication skills and attention to detail allow her to maintain order with an ever-expanding workload.

Since her start date, I have been impressed with Meredith’s ability to pick up a brand new technology stack and be able to communicate effectively. Additionally, she has been able to gain the trust of her team (10+ contractors) and handle a number of HR challenges. 

Meredith has worked with me on a weekly basis in order to prioritize and communicate the highest priority Map Tools feature requests/issues. She is able to see through her team’s wants and identify the items which are actually needed.  Additionally, Meredith put together an extremely detailed requirements document for the Operator Management system a few weeks after her start date. Utilizing this document as a guide, the Labeling team was able to focus their engineering efforts on work which had a real-world impact.  

Meredith consistently goes above and beyond the expectations and likely has the one of the most stressful positions in the organization. Without her consistent drive, many of the map production deliverables would likely not have been possible. 
",,,Dan Fitzpatrick,dfitzpatrick@argo.ai,Meredith Whitney,mwhitney@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Meredith tends to put a lot of burden on herself in order to maintain a quality process and ensure proper deliver. She should focus on elevating members of her team to assist in her daily activities. Additionally, Meredith should be more vocal about areas of improvement that she would like to see from other teams (i.e. on-vehicle testing feedback). 

Meredith should work closely with the engineering teams to identify problem areas and prioritize solution development. For example, the MAPREP team could likely spend ~16 hours to automate map release notes which would pay dividends in the long-run.

Finally, Meredith should work on implementing a shift-based schedule for map escalations in order to avoid being the single-point-of-failure and to improve her work/life balance. Meredith is consistently fielding questions from the executive team on weekends and after hours which is not a sustainable solution.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"I needed to learn more, more quickly.  The Pittsburgh Demo map segmented the map that we'd previously been running on... sort of.  While the previously approved route had significant limitations, the North Shore was operational.  When we published the demo route, we effectively and unintentionally deprecated that area.  I should have asked more about map unification.

Additionally, I need to be better about setting boundaries and time out for actual work, not meetings.  There are a lot of balls that get dropped in favor of over communication.  I need to remember that sometimes it's ok to lock yourself in a booth and knock out work, and I need to communicate that I need that time to be effective.  I'm thinking, in particular, of Pittsburgh.  A number of base map issues were discovered late in the game.  Instead of immediately tackling them, I continued working on my other projects because they had a lot going on.  I should have been more open more quickly about what was going on where, so that someone could have stepped in and helped, or at least rearranged my priorities so that they better aligned with the organization's.

I also need to work on ensuring that my team is one of my top priorities at all times.  They cannot slip off my radar, as they need support, mentoring, and leadership.  They're looking to be part of a whole, not feel isolated.  It's my job to provide inclusivity and visibility so that they understand how integral they are to the company's success

I can most definitely improve on my organization here.  As previously mentioned, there are so many things going on that it's tough to keep them straight.  Having a log of all tickets, their status, their relationship to the map, etc., will be helpful in keeping everyone abreast of the status of each map.  

And finally: I need to learn to ask for help and to take it when it's offered.  I tend to worry (needlessly) that asking for help will make me obsolete, when, in reality, it will simply help me to focus my efforts more directly on the company's priorities.",,,Meredith Whitney,mwhitney@argo.ai,Meredith Whitney,mwhitney@argo.ai,Software,

Michael has always been able to answer questions about how the simulation is working at a deeper level.  For example, when looking into the differences between waypoint and route movers or single movers vs. traffic movers (before they were deprecated), or looking into the details of triggers, Michael has been able to provide clear explanations of how the system works that both make it easier to use the simulation to best of its capabilities and also demonstrate that he has a strong understanding of how the simulation is organized.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"---What are some specific accomplishments, projects, and results that you drove during the review cycle timeframe? / Think about not only results, but also about how you collaborate and work with others.

From early on in my time at Argo, I was the go to person for scenario creation collaborating with AI, MP, and MC teams on a regular basis. Some of these scenarios required an immediate turnaround to avoid delaying necessary fixes for the AV.

Being heavily involved in scenario creation, I created an initial version of scripts to be used for scenario permutation. These scripts and the resulting scenarios helped to achieve the company wide OKR goal associated with simulating 100k miles per week [without just simulating the same scenarios repeatedly].

Next, I was a key contributor in the Ford BOD Simulation video. After the initial scenario was created by SimOps, I spent countless hours refining the scenario which was used in the video to ensure SimEng was showing realistic behavior as we pushed the complexity limit to the highest it had ever been in the Simulator. This video also had a lot of great pushes and collaboration internally between the SimEng team to make sure we were able to showcase the capabilities of the Simulator in an outward facing and professional way.

After creation of the SimOps and STS teams, I was able to focus more of my efforts towards contributing to the SimEng codebase, while still being one of the key points of contact between SimOps/STS and the SimEng team.

Some of the key efforts I have pushed in the SimEng codebase were:
a) Developed models for the Simulated Mover behavior which uses realistic acceleration and deceleration to control Mover velocity changes.
b) Simulated Mover Source Sink behavior capabilities which gave the ability for Movers to be sourced as time went along in the simulation, as well as the ability for any type of Mover to be removed from the simulation when they reached their end point (prior options for Movers were either to remain at the final waypoint, or to be transported back the start of their path).
c) MapQA via Simulation to verify that the AV was able to drive in the lanes on the entire Map without requiring the Mapping team to need to manually spend time checking all lane segments of the map.

The wiki documentation I created over this review period was associated with Scenario Creation (i.e. How to use Sim GUI Tools), MapQA, and Event Triggers.

Lastly, up until recently when this process migrated to the STS team, I had been running the Sim Nightly Regression Tests each morning and performing the initial triage step to help solve problems that arose due to changes to the codebase from the previous day.

---What are areas where you have grown and made improvements?

I feel that I have grown quite significantly since my start at Argo. Being highly involved in scenarios allowed me to learn about many different aspects of the company. I always tried to put myself in a position to assist other teams in a way that would simplify their task, while learning as much as I could about details related to the problem they were solving.

Additionally, I was able to gain an immense amount of knowledge related to the Argo codebase. This has helped and will continue to help me to better apply my expertise in modeling and simulation in the appropriate places of the Simulator, as well as other applicable areas of the codebase.

---Specific examples regarding demonstrated sustained performance at the next level / Concrete examples regarding impact on company and team goals

I believe I am currently performing at the next level (I am currently at Level 3). As I have highlighted above, I am a key contributor to many important aspects of the SimEng team. I interact regularly with cross functional teams (e.g. SimOps/StS, MP/MC/AI, Mapping). I take ownership of team’s work and push for action and results, as well as being a solid contributor to both team and organization OKRs (e.g. Ford BOD Simulation video, 100k miles simulated per week OKR). I am extremely reliable and relentless with my tasks to ensure the work gets done properly while using a detail oriented approach. This at times means juggling multiple threads of work while still keeping priorities in mind to ensure the success and progression of the organization (e.g. high priority scenarios that need to be done immediately, issues found when running the Sim Nightly Regression Test). During design discussions I try to use my expertise in modeling and simulation to suggest standards and guidelines to ensure realistic and accurate behavior will be present in the Simulator. Furthermore, I have identified and fixed complex system bugs (e.g. argoai/av#2567 is an example of finding a typo in the motion plan generator message timeout config which caused the configuration to not be used and for timeouts to default to 0 seconds which caused the motion plan generator to timeout). Lastly, I am beginning to develop mastery in the SimEng codebase.

---How long has sustained performance been demonstrated (weeks, months, etc)

I believe I have demonstrated sustained performance at the next level for the last 1.5 to 2 months.",,,Michael Nayhouse,mnayhouse@argo.ai,Michael Nayhouse,mnayhouse@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Right from the start Michael became the main point of contact for creating scenarios for the simulation.  He continues to lead the way for scenario creation using new maps and integrating simulation components.

Michael also played a key role in getting simulation scenarios to run nightly regression in the cloud and was responsible for launching and reporting the simulation batch.  He would then triage the resulting analysis and assist teams with any failures. He then assisted the STS team to hand off the nightly regression to their team.

Michaels work with scenarios and nightly regression led to his main role in MapQA which supports the mapping team in QA of new maps.

I worked closely with Michael on the scenario and features for the Ford BOD Simulation video.  Together we were able to rapidly add and integrate new features into the simulation and Micheal spent considerable time analyzing and refining the scenario.  Specifically Michael created the feature that provides realistic acceleration and deceleration to the movers which greatly improved the realism of behavior in simulation.

Michael also created the feature for source sink of movers in the simulation.  After a few iterations and getting to know the simulation architecture he was able to integrate a new feature component outside of existing infrastructure.

Michael is usually the first to jump on scenario and sim questions in the slack.  Overall is doing a great job taking the lead on scenario creation and triage of regression issues.

---What are some projects where you could have done better?

The project that I feel I could have done better on was the Simulated Mover Source Sink behavior capabilities. This was the first project where I needed to touch many pieces of the Sim codebase which I was unfamiliar with, as well as my first time working with the Argo infrastructure to add new ASL definitions. There are a few reasons that this project took longer than expected. Specifically the learning curve of the codebase, in addition to a number of high priority tasks that came up while working on this project.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Mike is probably the person who I got help from the most in NJ office in the transition period from PLI to Argo-Lidar. He was always willing to learn `the Argo Way`,  transferring the information to all Argo Lidar team, improving the use of communication tools. He is always responsive to the Opto-Mechanics team needs and makes an effort for us to get the information we need. I always prefer to include Mike even in our team-meetings so that he can follow-up with our internal tasks and update/follow up with/convey the Opto-Mechanical progress through Kanban/Jira/meeting minutes to other teams. He has pretty good amount of work on his plate being TPM for Lidar Team, arranging and leading team-wide meetings when communication is missing, reaching to systems team to help defining requirements, following up with Hardware/Tiara teams through me and separately to update Lidar Team for future needs, working in Quality etc. I am very happy to work with Mike as a talented team-mate and as a nice person.",,,Bilge Kocer Yumer,byumer@argo.ai,Michael Prud'homme,mprudhomme@argo.ai,Hardware,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Michael serves in the quality and program management roles

During the transition, Michael was a self initiated champion of identifying and becoming quickly familiar with the new Argo workflow, especially in areas of communication, collaboration and tracking tools.  This has enabled him to demonstrate by example for the rest of the engineering team.
His engagement with off-site members of technical teams has been critical for advising local engineering on the contacts and expertise that exists in other offices, this had lead to effective collaborations and acquiring help in critical areas. 
Attends numerous cross-functional meetings, providing detailed notes, registering action items and issue tracking.

Locally, he has been instrumental in solidifying and recording the top level and sub-system level requirements, as well as Gantt style scheduling for the various tasks and milestones. 

Michael has been working to identify automotive and Ford specific quality requirements and provisions, including functional safety requirements.  This is one particular area that is new to the legacy PLI staff and is a critical understanding that we gain in the development of the LiDAR systems.

Michael has also been providing administrative assistance to the VP of LiDAR that enables focus on other business and development concerns.

I believe continuing growth would be beneficial in becoming more familiar with the technical interplay and tradespace between the various sub-systems, leading to a deeper understanding of the relative importance or priorities concerning the set of challenges we face in development.  Rely more upon the the stakeholders and technical leads to establish priorities and scheduling of actions that arise from engineering meetings.  I would recommend being more cognizant of over-reach or risk of undermining the lead’s task planning and management roles.

Expand automotive quality guidance and dissemination of applicable requirements.
Additional emphasis on maintenance and expansion of quality processes that have been developed in legacy operations and optimize them for the Argo prototyping and production operations.
Make internal communications more personal and meaningful with more face-to-face discussions.
Increase understanding of the real-world challenges and constraints of the task owners and stakeholders.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"The major project/accomplishment that I drove during the review period was the completion of the major design tasks for the Oakley variant of the GMAPD synchronous camera.  All the designed sub-assemblies were successfully integrated into a functioning camera that was ready to be handed over to team members for specialized test/tune completion steps.  Some of the major tasks/accomplishments for this project are as follows:

1.) Reviewed existing schematics and identified several issues that may have led to board re-spin if left undetected.  Made modifications to the schematics to accommodate mechanical and electrical design changes.

2.) Performed PCB layout for all of the sub-assembly boards which included high speed signals, complex BGA routing, and flex circuit material.  These boards were completed with minimal supervision and required significant self learning of the layout tools to complete.  The resulting boards were successful and worked on the first spin.

3.) Collaborated cooperatively with mechanical engineering through several iterations of changes until a final design was converged upon.     

4.) Generated and organized parts lists for all the sub-assembly PCBs and facilitated the ordering of all the components including the selection of the PCB fabrication house. 
 
5.) Tested individual sub-assemblies prior to final integration and identified and fixed several hardware issues that were oversights/mistakes from the original design.  Hardware modifications and white wires were implemented in all existing PCBs.

6.) Troubleshooted existing firmware/software for the camera design .  Identified and fixed several issues with the firmware/software to bring the camera to a functional state. 


Following the design work on the legacy Oakley camera project I started to get involved with the Lidar development.  The following summarizes some of the tasks I have been involved with:

1.) Coming up to speed with the new firmware design tools (Xilinx Vivado).  

2.) Implementing an Aurora transceiver interface combined with DDR4 and GbE IP into the VCU118 development board for the purpose of FPGA power consumption estimation. 

3.) Investigating ways to use the Xilinx BERT IP to potentially test the robustness of the high speed communication interface of the rotating platform brass fixture.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"An area for growth and improvement would be to inject myself more into the the Lidar development and gain a better understanding of all aspects of the design architecture.  My work on the legacy Oakley camera project has put me a little behind the rest of the company in terms of early design concepts of the new Lidar system, learning new design tools, and overall integration in the Argo company.  Some additional focus and effort should allow me to catch up and play a key role in the Lidar development.

Looking back at the Oakley project, the only thing that I think I should have done better is that I should have asked questions sooner when confronted with a problem.  I have a tendency to try to figure problems out my own but there were a few occasions where I realized if I had asked a question sooner, I would have saved some development time.  I believe improving communication with my peers will go a long way helping with my career development.

While there is room for improvement, I believe that I have tackled every challenge that has been given to me and proven that I can handle the responsibility of both small and large projects.  I have rated myself a 4 because I believe that I exceed the performance for an Engineer 1 category and am ready for promotion to Engineer 2.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Since starting at Argo in August of 2017 I feel that I have shown continued growth, increased responsibility, broad Cross-functional impact, and sustained org impact.  The information and examples below should make my case for promotion from a Level 4 (TPM II) to a Level 5 (Senior TPM) in this review period.  

Organizational Impact:
A Senior TPM should have a hand in the significant impact of their team’s achievements.  An example of how I have demonstrated this throughout this review cycle is the visualization (viz) team’s end of year push.  In early December, 2017, the Viz team was given a list of features that needed to be implemented to the viz task by the 2nd to last week of the year.  I worked with the team lead, and engineering manager, to prioritize and estimate the tasks; based on this estimation we made a case to borrow 5 team members within Argo to ensure we were able to achieve our goal.  Throughout the effort, I had daily syncs with the team lead, sent out daily status to executives to share progress and gather feedback, and coordinated delivery of dependant features from external teams.  We delivered all features on time, and the internal software teams were able to utilize the improved Viz for end of year videos.  The improvements were well received by Argo executives per Bryan’s feedback to us: “Excellent work! We've come such a long way since just a month or two ago. Thanks for making sure we can show off the great work Argo has done this year. Really big deal!”

Leading the fail-functional actuator validation on the M1B is another project where I demonstrated significant on the team’s achievements.  This project was a cross-functional effort between motion controls, autonomy integration, vehicle ops, and systems.  The goal was to get a vehicle with surrogate Z1 fail-functional actuator hardware, test the vehicle laterally and longitudinally to ensure there were no regressions from Z0 hardware, and provide approval to Ford prior to the Z1 hardware freeze date.  The project got off to a bumpy start, as the vehicle delivery was delayed from the Ford side.  I coordinated with Ford throughout the process and communicated status to the stakeholders within Argo.  At the same time I worked with the teams that planned to utilize the vehicle to coordinate schedule and timing.  When the vehicle arrived we began to execute according to the schedule.  After having the vehicle for a short time, we began to have issues.  I communicated the issues to Ford, Chris Brewer in an EMM, and requested prompt response due to our compressed schedule.  I coordinated the vehicle fixes with Ford and helped the teams continue testing.  The validation was completed 1 week late due to a snowstorm in Dearborn, but we were able to provide Ford agreement to proceed with Fail-Functional actuator hardware in time for the hardware to be delivered for the Z1 breadboard.  

Additionally, I support my teams and the org by ensuring that the teams I work with deliver to their OKRs.  A specific example of this is that SIM had a Q4-2017 OKR to simulate 100K miles by the end of the quarter.  I was tracking the delivery of all of the task to do batch simulation in the cloud, which the teams delivered the last working week of the year.  On the last working day of the year, I was the only person tracking the progression of simulated miles.  I noticed that the miles stagnated throughout the day.  I reached out to the Offboard and SW leads to escalate the situation.  Working together we were able to deliver over 100K simulated miles prior to the end of the year which achieved the okr 100%.  

Communication:
A Senior TPM is expected to provide excellent feedback and is able to articulate complex issues to people of all levels and capabilities.  One example of a project where I demonstrated this is working with Kelly Bennett on creating new graphics for the visualization GUI HUD.  During the December push for the visualization team, there was a request for a set of graphics at the top of the GUI to show the speed limit, whether or not the car was in autonomy, the traffic light state we were detecting, and more.  For the end of the year we input a set of engineering approved graphics.  We knew these needed to be improved, and I heard that Kelly, in Pittsburgh, had done some graphics design work for Argo.  I reached out to her, explained the situation, and she agreed to help.  In order to ensure that we didn’t have to go through multiple iterations, I knew it was critical to have good communication up front as Kelly does not have an AV or robotics background.  So, I created a slide with the graphics we had, called out what we were trying to show with each, and had a meeting with Kelly to go over each of the graphics we were looking for.  It was successful.  The first iteration of her design captured the purpose of each icon. I provided feedback, and requested a couple minor tweaks.  The final icons were delivered in time for the viz team to incorporate into their GUI HUD refactor.

Additionally, I am able to speak to, and influence, teams on a technical level.  This can be seen via my work on the CAN interface and signal development between the Argo Compute and the vehicle platform.  During my work with the motion controls team, I realized there was a gap on the Argo side for which team would ultimately be responsible for the CAN interface development as well as the Argo Comms to Ford CAN signal translation.  I worked with teams internally (MC, Systems, Hardware, Embedded SW, AInt, Infra) to work through the block diagram of how Comms would need to flow from the Argo compute to the Ford platform.  Through these discussions we ultimately were able to get teams to claim responsibility for Aurix CAN interface development (E.SW.), CAN message requirements (Systems), and Argo Comms to CAN message development (Infra).  Each team has an execution plan for Z1.  

A senior TPM should be able to sell and defend their approach to solving a problem.  I have demonstrated this trait with my influence on how story points and team capacity are calculated.  The SW-TPM team was looking for a method on how to compute and compare loading across the teams.  During my work with the simulation team I learned they used the fibonacci sequence that was loosely translated into portions of a week.  I had already standardized this method across the teams I worked with, and was able to sell the method to the other SW-TPMs.  This is now the standard method for Argo on sizing stories and team capacity.

Team Work:
A Senior SW TPM should be able to bring groups together to discuss issues, resolve disputes, and work through a plan.  An example of this is leading the effort to define responsibility between simulation tools and scenario creation.  Early on while working with the simulation engineering team I was told that, long-term, the simulation team would not be responsible for creating actual simulation scenarios.  At that time there had not been discussion, to my knowledge, of who would ultimately take on this responsibility, so I started the conversations.  After a few discussions between the Sim engineering manager, myself, TestOps, and the systems lead; we were able to come up with a plan for how scenario creation would be managed.  I ultimately shared this information with an executive in a 1:1, it was well received, and soon after SimOps and STS were created with Simulation creation as part of their R&Rs.  After SimOps and STS’s inception, I made an effort to ensure that communication was built up between them, SimEng, MC, and MP.  This communication bridge has given SimOps and STS better insight into the feature roadmap for the teams and allowed the teams to better utilize the resources of SimOps and STS.  I have heard directly from the STS engineering manager that he appreciates the communication bridge that I have established between all of the teams.  

Another example of my team work can be seen via my coordination between vehicle ops and visualization for the co-pilot argonaut overhaul.  Because there are a lot of users of the visualization tools, the team gets a lot of one-off requests.  This situation was causing the inability for the viz team to prioritize work.  After this was communicated out, vehicle ops assigned a single point of contact to be the interface between vehicle ops requests and the visualization team.  The vehicle ops lead, viz lead, and I began meeting to understand how all the little requests culminated into a bigger picture view of where we wanted argonaut to be, we broke that down into smaller, actionable chunks, and prioritized the development work.  This has allowed the viz team to deliver small improvements that are working towards a larger goal.

Leadership:
There are multiple areas  where I feel I have exhibited leadership, beyond expectation, this quarter.  First, was during the Viz teams transition in leadership.  The team had their team lead leave and engineering manager change within a couple weeks of each other.  I devoted extra effort to ensure that the team was able to extract as much knowledge from the departing team lead as possible.  The result was a smooth transition with no tasks failing to get addressed.  
Second, for Q2 2018 planning, I lead the roadmap development for MP, MC, Sim, and Viz.  This included one or more working sessions with the TL and EM to whiteboard up the plan, migrate the plan to an roadmap in drive, identify dependencies and deliverables, and gain cross-functional agreement between the teams on the plans.  All of this was completed on time and the roadmaps have been well received by the teams. 
Also, I have mentored quite a few new members of Argo.  We had many new SW-TPMs start this review period and I helped bring them up to speed on the structure of Argo, the SW team divisions, how our AV software worked, standard practices for the SW-TPMs, etc.  Additionally, I took the opportunity to similarly mentor the new lead for the prediction team when he started.  I feel that my effort in mentoring these new members was a benefit to the overall org.

I believe all of these examples prove how I have shown continued growth, increased responsibility, broad Cross-functional impact, and sustained org impact and should be promoted to a Senior TPM in this review cycle.",,,Mike Lambert,mlambert@argo.ai,Mike Lambert,mlambert@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Mike has been a fantastic TPM to the MC team.  Without his support a lot more balls would be dropped on my end!  

I am enthusiastic and thankful for how he has taken leadership in coordinating the transition to fail-functional actuators for Z1 with Ford.  

Mike has been very helpful in quarter and sprint planning.  He brings up dependencies he notes with other teams and helps me to schedule work effectively.  He has also shoulders the burden of keeping executives up-to-date in our work plan via the sprint tracker.  ",,,Scott Varnhagen,svarnhagen@argo.ai,Mike Lambert,mlambert@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Mike led many efforts within the TPM team, the Dearborn office, and in relation to his role as TPM for the MP&C (and sim/viz) teams. However, a few particular instances stand out to showcase the contribution Mike regularly makes at Argo.

The M1B and Z1 Fail-Functional efforts required coordination across Argo (HW, SW, and Ops) and various units within Ford. Mike led this effort for Argo, but kept the relevant Tech Lead, Systems Engineers, and Operations Managers in the loop appropriately. Before Mike stepped up in this role, there were multiple different venues to discuss the topic, information wasn't shared widely, and frequent miscommunications (or lack-thereof) occurred. Mike has become the trusted souce on both the Argo and Ford side as the POC on the project.

On another project, Mike assisted in transforming Simulation at Argo. Simulation is an important part of Argo's software development and system testing pipelines. Mike drove the effort to productionize this process by splitting up the effort into 3 groups: simulation tools, STS, and SimOps. Through many lead-up conversations, Mike quickly came up to speed on the current state, vision, and the needs of the overall simulation system at Argo. He then proposed some changes, gained advocates, and convinced others of the needed changes. Then he worked across the org to help put these changes into place.

Mike also has been a strong advocate for creating a great work environment and culture at Argo. He has been instrumental in setting up events that support a more connected office in Dearborn, e.g., luncthime social events, Nerf-gun battles, and an overall positive (and contagious) attitude at work. He is also a strong advocate for the Women at Argo movement. ",,,Ryan Morton,rmorton@argo.ai,Mike Lambert,mlambert@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"It's been great having you as a motion planning interface in the MI office. I can mainly speak to your accomplishments as they relate to our interactions on the systems team, which is subset to what you listed in your self-review. 

I believe your collaboration skills in the TPM role is likely your greatest strength. You are easy to work with, have good connections across the organization and are able to get support from those needed. You've also stepped up and helped me with the SA interfaces to Ford Research team which has been a struggle from a bandwidth perspective.

You have a good understanding of how systems work together and what needs to get done to accomplish a task.

Finally, it's great that you support the ERG's and social events related to work (golf, etc). This really helps build relationships which is critical.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Mike has been exceptionally helpful as a TPM to me and my teams.  He was instrumental in keeping me and my teams on time with quarter planning, OKRs and OKR scoring, and tracking dependencies for us across teams.  Mike works my leads every week to ensure weekly updates are completed and capture the state of the teams' progress.  He is always willing to help out with slides and outward communication.  Mike is never afraid to dig in with the teams; he joins us and helps with planning, dependency identification/tracking, and documentation.

Recently the Viz team had a change in org structure and the TL left Argo.  Mike worked to make the transition as smooth as possible, leaving me available to lean in more with my other teams.  

Mike is a real team player.  He never talks about what is his job and what is not; he does his best to help everyone however he can.  He identifies gaps and does what he can to fill them.  ",,,Al Costa,acosta@argo.ai,Mike Lambert,mlambert@argo.ai,Software,

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"One of the areas that has been a continuing challenge from my perspective is understanding the program assumptions, deliverable timing, due dates and how that maps into the various work-streams. This is more of an overall TPM question than for your role specifically, but I thought it may be something that could be discussed assuming the TPMs have a forum where they meet together. We hear a lot of potential change requests, discussions, etc so something that we can rely on for the true program / SW team assumptions would be great. go/architecture was pretty good but I don't think it's the single source of truth anymore since Ford owns the program assumptions.

Related to this, I am also observing that sometimes I am not sure what other teams are working on and vice versa. An example of this is the Situation Awareness project. I was part of a team that had worked on a Z2 SA architecture and didn't know there was another team working on the Miami SA event until the review with the Ford research team where it came up. Z0 could be a different solution than Z2, but keeping the long term architecture in mind could help scope that work as well. Thanks for looping me in to the Z0 slack channel!

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,I would like to see Mike take additional leadership during meetings.  (specifically Ford meetings). He should drive the Argo agenda and take notes which are dispersed to all relevant parties at Argo each week.  He could certainly do more to help communicate to the greater org the decisions we are making in these meetings.  ,,,Scott Varnhagen,svarnhagen@argo.ai,Mike Lambert,mlambert@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Mike should continue to push himself to be more assertive about the technical aspects of our work.  There are a number of times in meetings where I'm certain Mike knows the answer, but often defers to the leads.  He should continue to grow his technical depth and understanding, but more importantly he should work to become more comfortable speaking to it with confidence.  He constantly asks good questions in our internal meetings and seems to have a solid understanding of the tech.  I have no doubt that Mike can and will excel here in the future!",,,Al Costa,acosta@argo.ai,Mike Lambert,mlambert@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Mike asks great questions, it's one of his best attributes. He often sits quietly in meetings, listening, then just before the meeting ends he'll ask a question that gets to the heart of the issue. However, there are two areas where Mike could leverage this skillset to have an even greater impact on the org.

Firstly, when interacting externally (outside MP&C), he could ask probing questions regarding how his teams could better serve their customers. There's a natural tendency to want to defend our teams or colleagues, by justifying the decisions/processes chosen. Yet, the overall success of the program is the primary goal. 

Secondly, I'd like to challenge Mike to ask more tough questions in the meetings he's attending  (tech, all-hands, etc.), Don't be afraid of a long answer to one of these questions, or even a ""let's connect after the meeting to dive in"" type of response.

I was able to quickly gain confidence in promoting a release candidate to fleet based on thorough testing.I was also ( along with my team) were able to give immediate feedback to developers in a timely manner when when facing possible issues/bugs. In addition, I was able to learn from past mistakes made in the testing process by reaching out to fleet ops(our customers) and developers , and thus making appropriate changes to the testing methodologies. As a result, testops was able to better filter issues before they reach fleetops. 
*Completed vehicle test requests by working with the development team and gave results/feedback in a timely manner.This has allowed the development team to quickly integrate SW into the release candidate. I was able to improve my testing methodologies including taking effective notes and testing various edge cases to help better understand testing. 
* Worked with developers to land major features such as 2 way stop intersection predictions, cut-in mode, tracking(lidar+camera integration) before they arrive onto the release candidate. This involved testing features with multiple times thru multiple tests and giving immediate feedback.
*Made significant changes to Playbook Report to illustrate onsite testing,improve readability and repeatability, and reflect current testing requirements. In addition, I worked with my team to integrate an issue tracker with the report.  
*took the initiative to reach out to visualization team to make testops specific tags(annotations taken during testing) that reflect our testing process. As a result of working with the visualization team, testops was able to come up with a complete visualization tool that allowed us to take better and consistent notes.
*Worked with the development team to come up with test cards that can effectively test features coming down the pipeline. This also included adjusting test cards to meet system limitations. In addition, i was able to create test cards from common issues seen on the test tracks to better track feature progression/regerssion.
* assisted fleet in getting issues seen on the road that were also seen on closed course, to the right development team.
* maintain testops cheat sheet with important commands/information that is also used by fleetops and other engineers.

He went through much of the same process our VO's would in terms of learning and familiarizing himself with the vehicle and it's system.  He was able to efficiently acquire the knowledge necessary to conduct his testing in a rather short period of time.  Before I knew it, he was able to conduct playbook testing as well as alter the testing as necessary with regard to the capability of the release being tested.  Nebeyu has always been very thorough in his testing from what I have observed.  If a particular test is in question, he will repeat the test multiple times in order to see if the undesirable result is a repeatable instance.  If it is/isn't repeatable - he proceeds accordingly.  While testing, he will often also take notes on specific things of interest.  This could be anything from a turn we take really wide, to a spot on the map where we slow down for an initially unknown reason.  He seems to dig in on these issues.  This is great for multiple reasons.  He is able to effectively feed information back to the developers in a timely fashion so that issues can be resolved much quicker.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Coming in as more of an algorithms developer, Nick has gone above and beyond of what I believe what was originally expected of him.  Normally those who come from academia have a harder time getting up to speed in the argo code base, but from day one he was writing tasks and getting ready to integrate them on the vehicle.  I would consider him to be well above the average C++ developer at argo, including those who are on infrastructure and in more of a development role.  He has the unique ability to combine algorithmic insight, and technical C++ knowledge to many problems throughout the codebase, ranging from purely algorithmic decisions to purely systems-level programming decisions.

Nick has already laid out many of the tasks which he has worked on or completed, however I will add additional insight for each of his tasks as to it's affect on other teams.

* GPU pipeline for images
- Helped not only the detection team but also traffic lights and the infrastructure teams integrate their tasks into the pipeline.

* Camera shutdown debugging.
- In additional to diagnosis and support, he worked cross-functionally with hardware and software teams to solve the issues.
- For this debugging, he pretty learned complex network diagnostic skills that rivaled what I learned as a network engineer at facebook.

* Lidar Pipeline
- In addition to his own work on the pipeline from a software standpoint, he again worked cross-functionally with the hardware team to understand the hardware s.t. he could write efficient and accurate drivers for multiple lidars.

* Stream Alignment Library
- After implementing his sream alignment library he assisted in the implementation and integration of the library in multiple teams including tracking, visualization, detection, and infrastructure.

* Vehicle Mask
- Again, worked cross-functionally with hardware to develop and efficient vehicle mask and worked with many teams to debug and integrate it.

A common theme of these scenarios is Nick's uncanny ability to work succesfully between teams and different teams of people.  Given that he has an algoirthmic background and has debugged everything from networking issues (hardware networking) to neural network issues (machine learning), Nick has gone beyond his job description and he has learned many new skills along the way.",,,Josh Manela,jmanela@argo.ai,Nick Meyer,nmeyer@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Worked with Nick on a number of his tasks and helped give input to many of them.

Lidar Pipeline: He was able to quickly implement his portion of the pipeline (the SLSA and the point generators). In the process he was also able to add the start of a lazy range library into the core repo. These pieces integrated into the final system with little issue. Then when the VLP128s showed up he was able to get that new sensor up and running within a few days.

Stream Aligner: Nick worked on unifying message alignment across multiple data streams into a single library. Previously everyone had a slightly different incorrect way of doing things. Nick created a single correct library that could be extended to handle all the use cases needed. The code ends up getting complicated in the library but Nick was able to implement it a task that not many of the engineers here could do.

Vehicle mask: The issue was that invalid data from reflected returns were causing parked cars to appear like they were jumping out at the vehicles. Here, we had a back and forth on how it should be approached. With very little input he was able to complete the task and implement a fast and efficient design.

Tracker Task: went through profiled and vectorized the tracker task. I'll be excited to see how his further updates to the tracker task improve performance.

Nick also became a C++ reader and I use him a lot for my reviews because he's fast and gives good feedback.

Nick is very easy to work with. He also learns and develops new skills very quickly.",,,Rob Keelan,rkeelan@argo.ai,Nick Meyer,nmeyer@argo.ai,Software,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"My first work with Niv was on work to develop lidar-specific requirements for Velodyne lidar and then for Argo lidar shortly after she started at Argo.  These are tasks that I had attempted in a few contexts over the years, and while I made some progress, Niv succeeded where I hadn't through a mix of clear and concise analytical work, a focus on the use cases, and key inputs I was missing, which she identified and obtained quickly.  

She was a key contributor through the initial pass of requirements and stretch goals for Argo Lidar development. Through this period, she was also strongly advocating for a deeper look into near-field coverage, which Argo had, to that point, deemphasized.  When issues and challenges started to arise, she made key contributions to understanding requirements and use cases for near-field sensing. Beyond that, she has also been a driving force behind the building of the formidable Bounding Scenarios analysis.  

Niv possesses a few qualities and talents that I would like to highlight. First, she brings a wonderful balance of, on the one hand, joy and levity, and on the other, rigor and professionalism, to reviews, meetings, touchpoints, 1:1's, off-hand discussions, and after-hours / team building that advances the core work but also keeps everyone excited by and engaged with the work.  Second, the analytical work I've seen her do is top-notch -- rigorous where it needs to be, efficient where efficiency is warranted, and above all, it cuts straight to the core of the problem. Third, Niv does a great job of communicating her methods and results with concise language and informative plots and animations, and she's skilled in the subtle art of 'messaging' for a particular audience. I'm very glad to know that people of her caliber are thinking globally about the challenges we face.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"I started working with Niv when she first joined Argo and since then, I am pretty happy with working with her, having technical discussions, and learning   a lot about sensors from her. 
She adapted to Argo pace pretty quick. She was willing to help us defining the Argo Lidar requirements after PLI acquisition, volunteered to join us in NJ trip to get to know people and learn more on the project. Thanks to her, requirements for FoV-range-resolution is getting more defined.
Niv became the bridge between software and hardware while I and Aaron initiated roof sensor placement in Z2. She helped us to understand software expectations, trade off between parallax-coverage in camera placement etc. I believe her helping with defining the requirements more clearly, hard and soft constraints etc. helped us a lot in decreasing the iteration amount in placement study! I worked extensively with Niv on sensor placement metrics,  short range sensor placement for Z2, requirements and following near-field sensor market survey as well. Her technical knowledge is impressive and she is always willing to help when needed even if she is overloaded.
I believe she is a good asset for Argo Team as being talented, modest, nice, and open for clear communication.",,,Bilge Kocer Yumer,byumer@argo.ai,Nivedita Chandrasekaran,nchandrasekaran@argo.ai,Software,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Accomplishments/projects:
1. Deriving, analyzing, and reviewing sensor-agnostic and lidar-specific sensing requirements with the Argo Lidar team for the AL Requirements Review in 12/2018: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1h9-6J6CUodrQBwv55QWH1Yvmwjx-YS8UtUZ0EU1ag5g/edit?usp=sharing
Worked with Perception/ML, hardware, and Argo Lidar teams to communicate requirements analysis as well as how they derive from AV use cases.
2. Messaging near-field sensing requirements/use cases to Ford: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G43qGLOh0VYqV45-c-foU6J3DtgPPjvvFHVT-q-MJKs/edit#slide=id.g3112e57b64_0_57
3. Z2 bounding scenarios (go/bounding-scenarios), Part 1: team effort with @dhartl to: (1) evangelize bounding scenarios to SW, HW, Argo Lidar, and Systems, (2) make 
the in-scope/out-of-scope line for J1 scenarios explicit, (3) take the bounding scenarios and objects deck through a formal upper management review with C-level and SW/HW tech leads. 
4. Z2 bounding scenarios (go/bounding-scenarios), Part 2, parameters+objects: Framed, derived, and analyzed sensor-agnostic requirements for bounding objects in three major bounding scenarios that flow directly to hardware far-field sensing requirements. Did analysis as a function of comfort, moderate, aggressive, and AVP max performance.
Collaboration - heavy assists from dhartl/kjackson on getting the right AVP information from Ford and sanity-checking calculations, repeated loops with SV on SW-Motion Control to check passenger comfort metrics (derived from tech leads, prior experience, vehicle data) and vehicle dynamics calculations.

Collaborations:
1. Short-range lidar/near-field sensing market survey: worked with HW (systems engineering, sensor integration, lidar engineering) on near-field sensing market survey
2. VLS-128a ESOW assistance - deriving a deliberately pessimistic set of range requirements that were still grounded in AV use cases to give HW Tech Lead more ammo in discussions
3. Z2 Sensor Placement Metrics: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KVdjP4GkcDiIoE-YnRLGfoAvBAfGNjdQy357y5YLYYU/edit?usp=sharing
Worked with HW sensor integration leads and SW leads to communicate (1) metrics for J1 sensor placement/integration and their derivation from AV use cases to make sensor placement trades explicit.

 Areas of growth: getting better at working with a multitude of teams, learning the organization, and building a table of peoples' areas of expertise (who to ask for what, when to ask a colleague to tag in).

If two projects are concurrent and of high importance, make sure to get buy-in from above for prioritization and allow yourself the chance to focus.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"Need to improve on:
1. Spending time on long-lead projects I KNOW are going to come up so that I'm more prepared if a sudden ask comes in. 
Example: Near-field use cases and sensing were an open issue in November, called it out, got a bit of pushback because of lack of people-hours, and left it alone until it came up with a vengeance in February. I should have socialized near-field use cases much earlier. 
2. Improving documentation/memos so that analysis is transferable and easily verifiable.
3. Being concise in reading/writing/speaking
4. Working with teammates in other offices by (1) delivering status updates/goals and (2) clearly laying out requests for help on a project I'm driving.
5. Prioritizing requests (or saying no to requests) so I'm not working like a FIFO queue.

Projects where I could have added more value:
Z2 Sensor Placement - could have added more clarity here for sure by more explicitly laying out use cases and being more conscious of HW integration<-->Ford tradeoffs/constraints. Improvement on this will probably come from working with HW mechanical leads on sensor integration.
Radar FoV/placement requirements - dropped the ball on this. Partially because I ran out of time, partially because I gauged that there wasn't  _that_ much customization that could be done with a radar vendor, but should have done more (delivered HFoV requirements, etc.).

Furthermore, I believe she can help us more via being more involved with Argo Lidar, seeing the product as a system engineer, as long as she (&team manager) is ok with it and her bandwith allows.",,,Bilge Kocer Yumer,byumer@argo.ai,Nivedita Chandrasekaran,nchandrasekaran@argo.ai,Software,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,report,"Patrick does an excellent job managing the SimEng team. He keeps meticulous tabs on all tasks to ensure the highest priority work is being completed. Additionally, he is proactive in making sure all team members have the resources necessary to accomplish our tasks. He also keeps a customer focus towards our work, ensuring we are providing value at all times to our clients. This also includes superb communication to our clients, keeping them in the loop at all times (i.e. notification of features added, behavior changes in sim, current plans, etc.).

Patrick starts by breaking down tasks into appropriate sized Jira tickets. Next, once the ticket gets started, he looks to better understand what is different between initial assumptions and what work actually needs to be preformed to accomplish each task. This allows for the team to adjust plans  and/or resources when necessary in a timely manner to ensure the team will continue to give our clients what they need to be successful.

Patrick also reviews nearly all work that the SimEng team does both in design doc form (i.e. all team members look to him for their blessing on design work), as well as in PR form prior to landing in the Argo code base.

Patrick's feedback helps the team work together more efficiently (e.g. parallelize high priority tasks, using each team member's skill set appropriately to maximize productivity) and ensure that we are achieving all of the teams OKRs (with priority being any task that relates to company wide OKRs).

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Feature Delivery:
-------------------------
The following features were delivered by the sim team during the specified review period and are all in active use and contributing to software development speed and robustness:

**Simulation framework** - created a software architecture to centralize simulation tasks and enable more complex behavior, moving away from the original MVP TaskManager based implementation - this framework has been a key enabler for all of the features which follow

**Sim GUI** - provided a graphical user interface to ease and speed scenario definition and provide a centralized sim visualization interface, effectively reusing existing visualization features as much as possible

**City coordinate migration** - migrated the simulation framework and all existing scenarios away from UTM maps to the city coordinate frame maps to enable the mapping team to eliminate time-consuming UTM map production processes from their workflow

**TL state simulation** - provided a mechanism for simulating traffic light state, along with utilities to ease state transition configuration

**Scenario organization** - established a mechanism for storing, organizing, and tracking scenario definition config files as well as a mechanism for tagging scenarios to produce related batches of scenarios

**Cloud sim execution** - helped to integrate a solution for executing simulation scenarios in the cloud, which eventually evolved into the jobs platform

**Sim metrics**  - established the first acceptance-based scenario metrics and led the effort to align metric definitions and reporting across the MP&C teams

**Sim regression testing** - established a process for executing simulation regression tests of specific code versions and reporting the test results in a useful manner, which built on the cloud sim execution and metrics frameworks

**Mover behavior improvements** - significantly expanded the complexity, realism, and flexibility of behaviors of simulated agents, including the addition of: realistic dynamics, mover interactions, intersection handling, and TL state handling - all of these features were implemented in time to demonstrate them in the Ford BOD video

**Random movers** - provided a mechanism for easily adding traffic density to a scenario without needing to explicitly configure each mover in the scene

**Sources / sinks** - provided a mechanism for creating simple time-based traffic flows

**Play-forward** - implemented a mechanism for performing closed-loop resimulation using data from a log with MP and MC algorithms in-the-loop, providing a surrogate vehicle to generate simulated pose. This provides the ability to determine what the AV would have done in a particular instance if the vehicle had remained in autonomous mode, and also to determine how a new version of code would react to the identical situation.

**Mapping QA Sim** - provided a mechanism for the mapping team to perform simulation-based QA on their maps to detect AV routing and navigation issues with perspective maps, with full coverage and without the cost and logistics of in-vehicle testing. This will help the mapping team to produce maps which are more robust on a faster timeline.

**Event triggers** - provided a modular mechanism for adjusting scenario parameters and behavior during a run by specifying a set of conditions which will trigger a specific response. This will enable scenario creators to create a wider variety of potential scenarios and also provide a mechanism for exhibiting more complex mover behavior.


Areas of Growth:
-------------------------
**Alignment with management priorities** - achieved a much greater degree of alignment with the priorities of the management team thanks to a centralized reporting mechanism (sprint tracker), more active solicitation of opinions on priorities, and better channels of communication about sim development state, timing, design, and scope

**Landing code faster** - achieved significant improvement in how quickly code gets landed thanks to pressing for smaller PRs, breaking tasks into smaller increments, and making code review a higher priority on the task list

**Better sprint planning and estimation** - improving the prioritization of features for planning of individual sprints and entire quarters as well as achieving better estimates in feature sizing, timing, and effort required thanks to more active solicitation and organization of potential features,  and assessing potential impact to downstream customers, functional requirements, and delivery timelines

**Increased team velocity** - the SimEng team is continually increasing the rate at which it is producing and landing code thanks to a larger focus on up-front design alignment, more accurate sizing, actively breaking tasks down in to small components, and shortening the feedback loop of status updates of the development process

**Keeping ahead of client demands** - as of mid Q1, the SimEng team is finally in front of MP and MC feature needs, and is now actively working to get ahead and stay ahead of STS and SimOps priority needs as well.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"I found a defect on the cooling system for the compute stack that potentially avoided a lot of down time for the fleet. When Dearborn was in need of help, I stepped up and organized it, set up the shop to be consistent with Pitt, and continue to fill in there. When, the engineers that I work with, have new software that I am unfamiliar with, I learn the program and aid in its upload to the fleet to expedite its progress. (MABX,PCM hardware monitoring,PITT firmware). I collaborated with co-workers to get all the available cars upgraded to the camera 28vdc in just three days time, then while in Dearborn, I completed all the camera upgrades the following week.",,,Paul Diges,pdiges@argo.ai,Paul Diges,pdiges@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,manager,Paul is way ahead of where we have expected him to be at this point and he has only been here a little over 3 months! Paul has been adapting to our group exceedingly well and has consistently been taking on more and more responsibilities. Our group is filling a position in Dearborn and Paul immediately saw needs and jumped on top of covering by developing a schedule and sorting out the mess of inventory and tools left behind by the departing technician.,,,Joe Serbin,jserbin@argo.ai,Paul Diges,pdiges@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"During the most recent review cycle, Paul has been a great addition to the team.  Early on, for the most part we only had one available technician to work on multiple vehicles.  Since Paul has come on board, he has spun up very quickly on the tech aspect of the job that is associated with the vehicles.    He has learned the appropriate startup and shutdown procedures necessary for working with the AV's at times.  

Paul has accumulated knowledge of the compute hardware and sensors that are incorporated into the vehicle.  I have seen him work with some of our engineers to learn and help implement hardware changes on the vehicle.  Paul has also gone out on the road around Pittsburgh to provide service in the field to a vehicle that needed assistance.  We had a vehicle that suffered a flat tire from a pothole.  Paul had already left for the evening, but had turned around to come back so he could go out to the vehicle.  He grabbed the transit van, went out to the vehicle, and changed their tire for them so they could come back to Depot.  

Paul works well with our team and his personality seems to mesh well with everyone.  I think being able to cohesively work with your team is essential to good communication and efficiency.  Paul has done that very well.  He also travels to our various locations to provide support and/or additional support as necessary.  This is instrumental to the our success.  Since we don't have enough vehicle technicians to staff every location at the moment, the support he provides helps to keep cars on the road as well as mitigate smaller vehicle issues before they become larger ones.

Overall, it has been great working with and alongside Paul.  I look forward to doing more work with him in the future.",,,Anuruk Buranathanit,aburanathanit@argo.ai,Paul Diges,pdiges@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Having started the week after Paul, he was a welcoming member of the team and a great resource to learn the company culture and daily routines of the position with.  Paul has worked with me on a daily basis to implement fleet-wide changes and is more than willing to stay late.  When performing the PCAN upgrade where we added an extra unit to each vehicle, Paul asked thoughtful questions as to its purpose and provided excellent feedback on my documentation to make the whole company stronger.  He is eager to learn beyond his role and to gain an understanding of the total vehicle system, as when he requested to have Linux installed on his computer so he could work with the compute system.  Paul assisted me greatly on the MABX/PSCM updates, working closely and frequently with me to update vehicles, sometimes  several times a day.  He understands what is best for the org in a moment and prioritizes work accordingly.",,,Matthew Puchalski,mpuchalski@argo.ai,Paul Diges,pdiges@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"-Paul has demonstrated exceptional dedication and commitment to accomplishing any task that he has been assigned.

-Paul works with a purpose and takes ownership of his assignments

-I have tasked Paul with many projects and every project he performed for me he completed quickly and professionally 

-Paul is not only an asset to the Pittsburgh Depot but also to the entire company

-I  consider Paul as my go-to guy for any tasks that I need accomplished

-One task I assigned to Paul was to help install the 128i lidar onto a Z0 fleet vehicle. Paul not only helped with the basic install but was able to provide input into solving some of the integration issues with installing the new sensor.

- Paul demonstrates the willingness to learn new technologies and does not back down from any task even if it is something that is outside of his scope of work. One example of this was a test that Dustin Yautz was performing at the depot to characterize the performance of the new 128i lidar with different amounts of dirt being applied onto the sensor. Paul was able to to assist Dustin by finishing out the test and collecting data for him without Dustin being by his side.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Concrete accomplishments:
- Launch Ops 2.1
- First draft HARA

Ongoing contributions to:
- Safety Concept

My work on Systems Architecture is mostly focused on designing for AV safety, which is an ongoing unsolved question. In this context, I would say one of my strengths is to start with the intent/spirit of the work and develop methods/processes as needed.

For example, when I first began working on the HARA, Argo already had a HARA template from Ford. I chose not to start with this template, largely because the spirit of a hazard analysis for software-heavy systems is different and broader in scope than the bottom-up reliability-based failure model in ISO-26262. Instead, I created my own top-down STPA-style hazard analysis focusing on system losses. This process led to a breakdown of loss events into collision-related vs non-collision-related safety events, which led to the discovery of a new safety goal not covered in prior Argo work: maintaining safe velocity/acceleration so as to not violate vehicle stability. This contributed to the expansion of Argo's safety strategy beyond the original set of safety goals.

I would say another one of my strengths is understanding and avoiding hazards in interactions between Systems and other teams. Given my prior experience, I am acutely aware that systems engineering has pitfalls, which includes designing in a silo and then imposing requirements on technical teams, often with unproductive outcomes. Therefore, for my contribution to the functional safety concept, I've been careful about bringing in SW teams early rather than diving in alone too far too quickly.

For example, from my current technical viewpoint, I like formal methods. I like the concept of using real-time road perception in addition to maps. I could certainly create a big list of FSRs and TSRs and impose them onto SW. Instead, I've chosen to have dialogues with individual leads and engineers early. I say ""I'm from systems, we're working on safety, we're trying to protect your function (or XYZ function) on-vehicle. We're acutely aware that if we're not careful, we'd end up designing in a silo and then imposing requirements on you, which we're trying to avoid."" 

The responses have been positive. Sometimes folks say ""yeah we've thought about that already, it's already in our roadmap"" or ""yeah I'd really have to think about that, it sounds useful but we don't know how to do it"" or ""yeah our code itself is compatible with formal methods but no one's looked at the compiler"". Practically everyone says ""you're welcome to talk to me as needed"". Admittedly the interaction with SW is still in its early phases, but I believe I've helped set up the working relationship to be jointly productive.",,,Pei-Lan Hsu,phsu@argo.ai,Pei-Lan Hsu,phsu@argo.ai,Software,

Also worth noting, Pei-Lan communicates very well in that she not only listens well but also can precisely explain a complex scenario.  This is a new industry, and there are very few (if any) experts.  I think Pei-Lan has rapidly made a presence in our team with her tremendous growth in functional safety system analysis!

I believe it's invaluable that we have different backgrounds that we can iterate on and merge into a better overall safety case. Me coming from Ford and you from Aerospace/RF chips provides different perspectives that are critical to ensure coverage. As you noted, you found things and added to the HARA and safety goals.

Your self-awareness and reflections you wrote in your self-review were also impressive. You have the humility and insights to be able to identify your strengths and potential growth areas which is a great attribute to have.

Finally, I appreciate how you think thru ideas and proposals and their impacts to the system. It's good to pressure test the system and processes.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"Areas for growth: (1) speed (2) depth (3) sociability

(1) Speed: the flip side of starting with the work's intent and not diving in immediately is that progress at the beginning is slow. When starting work on the safety architecture I spent a lot of time trying to simultaneously address FuSa and SOTIF and Product requirements. For a while I had trouble making meaningful progress and had to count on other Systems teammates to take the lead. This area I expect to improve after building a larger repertoire of safety-specific and SW-specific depth.

(2) Depth: my background in millimeter-wave chip / phased array design does not translate 1:1 here at Argo. While the systems engineering thought process does carry over, I currently lack depth in SW. I do not expect to be near PhD level, but I do expect myself to gain depth in AV SW + SW errors over the next two quarters.

(3) Sociabiilty: I don't like slack very much. I prefer not to be tethered to my phone. I have days when I like my computer more than I like talking to people. And when the technical teams are mostly in a different city, I've had my difficulties keeping the pulse on the rest of Argo. I do expect to improve here, as I've already started building rapport with folks for both mapping/localization as well as formal methods. More travel to Pittsburgh/Dearborn could greatly help as well.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"As mentioned above, I think your self-reflections are great.  I encourage you to ask for input from subject matter experts early in the process. I think we can save some time if we get SME input early to help guide our own research and investigation. You're Pittsburgh trip was a great start in this direction. I am glad it went so well. I understand part of this can be tricky if the SME is from Ford since we want our point-of-view while maintaining our relationship with Ford and aligning with their expectations. It will be interesting to see how we can use the experience with the HARA to sync with Ford on the Functional Safety Concepts.

The other suggestion I would recommend considering is to think about how previous work/efforts can be used. As you mentioned, this is a bit of a double-edged-sword in that a strength of yours is understanding intent and creating an approach based on that. The flip side is taking advantage of work already done that could potentially be used. The example for this one is the HARA. We went thru a few iterations and approaches before settling in on one. It didn't help that we got mixed guidance from Ford starting with functional and then moving to interface. For mature processes like ISO-26262, I'd suggest we look to utilized existing tools/templates to ""speak the language"" of the industry.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,report,"Peter has been both a fantastic manager and a fantastic coworker during my 10 weeks at Argo.  My primary motivation for joining Argo was to continue to work with him.  As for specific accomplishments and projects, I can only speak in depth about his work on the prediction team, however, comments from colleagues suggest that his work has been similarly impactful on tracking.  As the prediction lead and the first member of the prediction team, Peter has driven planning and vision for prediction on the AV.  To date that has largely focused on creating a distinct portion of the stack that sits between tracking and motion planning.  He has also developed a plan that simultaneously pushes the development of functional heuristics and puts us in a position to replace these coarse rules with learned functions in the future.  Notable heuristics to date include handling predictions around intersections and the classification of parked objects.  As always, his code is clean and readable and his designs are well thought out and intuitive.

With respect to Peter's management of both myself and other team members, he has been exceptional.  He is in the process of turning a team of former researchers into productive developers.  While we have formal 1:1s, Peter's frequent check-ins and perpetual willingness to make time ensure that I remain unblocked, positive, and productive.  His willingness to explain the reasoning behind core concepts and best practices ensures that I continue to learn and grow as a developer.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Since joining Argo in January, I have been leading the tracking and prediction teams.  

For tracking, one of my first tasks was to read through the code base, understand the current algorithmic approach, and identify shortcomings that could be fixed quickly and would provide significant performance improvements.  I worked closely with Ben Ballard and Ben Xinjilefu to identify several improvements that could be made.  My general philosophy was to focus on situations were the current code was working (e.g. tracking an object) but then failed (e.g. stopped tracking).  We focused on areas of code that accepted incoming values without additional sanity checking.  For example, ensuring the EKF internal state was only updated when the shape registration results where reasonable, and using a more robust data association algorithm that doesn't induce undesired behavior in order to satisfy a one-to-one matching constraint.  We made substantial improvements to the overall tracking performance (although only quantified visually), and I think everyone was impressed with how well we were able to handle the holiday crowds on Penn Ave.

For prediction, I was a team of one for a while, so I had to balance coding immediate improvements (filtering the noisy velocity estimates generated for parked cars in an attempt to stop them from becoming ACC targets) while simultaneously developing a design doc articulating the long term strategy for how prediction should be implemented.  I quickly brushed up on my C++ coding and picked up several new development skills (thanks to @ccunningham for teaching me the entire Argo process and @bballard for stepping me through interactive rebase with kdiff3!). As the former Disney team members started arriving at Argo, I helped them get up to speed with the Argo development process, as well as explaining the overall strategy for prediction.  I have directly helped with the code refactoring, as well as enabling new behavioral features.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,report,"I have only worked with Peter since mid February as a member of tracking team.

During the beginning portion Peter was very hands off.   He would stop by and provide technical direction and then move on to prediction which had a ton of work to do before the demo.  Even though his interaction was brief in general, he was always able to detect the correct issue with the software and provide quick clear guidance.  He is extremely sharp when it comes to his ability to see the underlying problem and then is very clear when describing the problem to others.  For a long time we had a suspicion that the registration was producing garbage results.   For multiple weeks during that time Peter suggested we plot the outputs of the weights, but due to other tasking and time and belief that the registration could not be that messed up it was decided to not plot the result.  This however was a mistake since near the demo date we plotted all the registration weights, and we saw how bad it was.  Possibly we could have provided a better system if we had followed his advice from the beginning.  This will be a mistake i will try not to make in the future.

Two major accomplishments. Is that he successfully lead the tracking and prediction teams in the run up to the demo.  (These are each worth an accomplishment)  People seem to be happy with him as a leader (I do not hear any dissent in the ranks)

However i do wonder if he could offload some of his load to others that is not deeply technical in nature.   (However this comes with its own challenges and risks).  

I also did notice that during the run up to the demo he seemed to be trying to carry the prediction team on his back.  That is good to some extent, that means he has what it takes to get the job done, but at the same time, it is probably better to try to spread the load and inspire the others on your team to pick up where they can.  I am not sure how much of this was done (as i am not on the prediction team), i just know that Peter worked a many long nights leading up to the demo. (I also realize that a large chuck of his team was trying to spin up during this time.   It is hard to hand off work when everyone is trying to get their head wrapped around how the software system works in full) ",,,Ben Ballard,bballard@argo.ai,Peter Carr,pcarr@argo.ai,Software,

Peter's team has had to to perform a ton of popup work over the past couple months. In so doing, this has caused his schedules and milestones to slip. Peter does a great job at filtering this and keeping his team focused and positive even while working long hours and weekends. The problem is that this shielding has extended into some TPM processes and procedures. Peter has already started to rectify this issue by having me talk with and word directly with his teams.  My advice would be to continue to lean on your TPM more to help filter the popup situations and adjust scheduling.

However, I also believe we have been doing a better job these past few weeks of planning what is able to be accomplished in a given sprint.  The only other thing I can think of is that sometimes the code review process has slowed down development when all of the features we are developing are blocked on reviews, so it might be helpful to have a clearer path of what the requirements might be for members of the prediction team to become C++/Python/bash reviewers, just to help provide a quicker mechanism for prediction code to be reviewed inside the team.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"I struggled to manage the various demands on my time in February and March.  More often than not, I was getting weekly reports to Jason after they were due. The biggest failure was that I didn't setup a regular cadence of 1:1 meetings with my direct reports (I have since rectified that).  The other big challenge has been balancing how I spend time with my direct reports.  Because so many team members were new to Argo (myself included!) a lot of Feb/Mar/Apr was focused on discussing the algorithmic aspects of the problems we were tackling, at the expense of the explaining the process (e.g. Jira).  With team members now up to speed, I'm able to spend time discussing the non-technical aspects with my direct reports during one-on-ones (of course, if he/she has technical questions we certainly discuss that too).

In retrospect, I may have devoted too much time to tracking in March.  Prediction fell behind, and it required several long nights implementing new last minute changes to the overall algorithmic approach (exaggerating the deceleration of cars that are expected to yield to the AV at intersections). I might have been able to split my time more evenly between tracking and prediction, and possibly avoided (or at least lessened) the big push required at the end of the quarter.

Another major adjustment for me has been the rigor of the planning process at Argo.  Disney had similar overall processes, but the granularity for the research lab was much coarser -- we generally weren't on the critical path, or if we were, people understood that research agendas can change very quickly depending on incremental experimental results.  Balancing the need for short term improvements against longer term research-type algorithmic advancements has been difficult.  It's easy to push-off research ideas when things start to slip, but at the same time, if they are neglected completely, we may miss potential breakthroughs.  I'm hoping the presence of interns this summer will help bring a better balance of the research directions for both teams.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"I have acted as a strong communicator and point of coordination for several projects since joining, often with minimal direction or guidance.

- Jumping in and owning ingest from first week on the job, without a dedicated engineering team.  This included getting up to speed on current state with IT and interns, delivering presentation to Bryan in second week, making trade-offs about brick capacity and ingest abilities, communicating status, coordinating with depot personnel, and stabilizing the project so that we could ingest data as cars were first hitting the road.
Ingest then transitioned to Overwatch, so that we could see the cars on a map and have chat working.  This did not have a team staffed for it - I led the project and rollout and worked with IT, LME engineers, and VehOps to accomplish.  I incorporated feedback from leadership and users and the project was a success.

- I recognized communication and documentation as an area requiring more structure when I joined.  I initiated the practice of creating wiki ""home pages"" for projects as a central point of information containing requirements and milestones, and this was received well by other TPMs (Ryan: ""This is awesome, it really shows what's going on"") and leadership.  I made easy to access information a core goal for the team.  Although our project planning strategies have evolved significantly since then, the wiki ""hub"" idea is still well received and being utilized to document key XF projects such as the Dearborn launch and centralizing links to roadmap plans.

- **A particular strength of mine** is in process improvement.  I regularly identify inefficiencies or poor mechanisms and suggest and implement improvements that benefit the org.  Small examples: Suggested our sprint numbering mechanism to improve understandability of when things would land and communication.  Identified the lack of a central point for documentation and repurposed the TPM home page to address this, which is actively being adopted now by other team members.  Identified issues in reporting sprint velocities and capacity and recommended improvements that are in line with scrum best practices.  Led the discussion with SW TPMs to gain consensus and implement the change.
Bigger examples:  Automation and tooling.  I've been leading the coordination of standardizing best practices for GitHub repos.  When I identified the inefficiency of tracking this in a spreadsheet and the likelihood of it getting out of date, I created a tool that uses the GitHub API to track this automatically for us.  The tool has been enthusiastically received by peers and Bryan S. and is being utilized to understand our repo layout.  I am also working on identifying other process improvement areas where automation and improved tooling could help such as sprint tracking and quarterly planning.  With the SW Development Convention doc, once I took on an ownership role of the doc, I polished it significantly and got it into a state suitable for an org-wide policy document.

- Worked with Lee to assemble all of Off-board from the beginning.  Achieved successful formation and growth of several teams enabling fast high-quality output.  Organized swim lanes and streams of work and dependencies before Off-board team was fully formed.  This required establishing customer and dependent relationships with metrics, triage, perception, and other downstream teams.  Assembled Story/Epic creation process and Jira workflow with teams.  Coached tech leads on effective communication.

- Performance Analysis. The PA team was disbanded and assumed by Lee's org.  There were immediate gaps identified around performance of the dashboard and metric overload.  I conducted interviews with the previous PA team and assembled a Google survey that was sent to the org to assess what was used and what was needed and presented the findings to leadership in one day.

- Triage. While Lee was on paternity, the triage team got shifted to his org with unclear direction.  I worked directly with Pete, the team, and end users to identify the problems with the platform and an immediate path forward to enable new functionality (VNC playback).  I worked with the dev team and triage ops to track rollout and testing of the functionality.  From there, I helped ramp up a new sprint cycle for the triage team, and eventually transitioned the work to the Data Core team.  Throughout I remained the point of contact for status and feature requests from the end user.
In addition, Infra. and Pete had a high priority ask of the team to add some features related to log slicing/download and map view of the logs.  I worked directly with Mark Shamis to iterate on how the functionality should behave and how to make it most clear and discoverable for users.  This highlights my affinity for **application design, workflow, and process efficiency improvements**, and is an area I seek out in TPM work.

- Incident log handling project.  This project was a high priority injection and very cross-cutting.  I learned and summarized the requirements from the detailed engineering designs and gathered together the key stakeholders to begin executing on actions.  I built a wiki for the project, communicated status, and navigated technical decisions with the team.
 
- Assisted Dave in Infra year-end planning before there was a dedicated TPM

- In general, keeping point on several non-project work streams to coordinate and keep teams flowing - nominating readers, arranging sprint cadence, sprint retros and action items, setting up tactical ops rotation for teams, establishing and gaining consensus on the SW development process.

- I have a very strong technical background having previously worked with teams building highly available services in AWS and am a strong contributor in discussions trying to reach a technical consensus on design and next steps.  I speak well with the engineers to earn their trust and buy-in and carve a path forward in complicated situations that satisfies all parties.  I utilize communication and organizational skills to pinpoint areas for efficiency and process gains.  I feel I've made significant improvements in learning how to better re-engage people to keep projects from stalling, and how to handle and route many requests without overloading the team.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"I am still working to adapt some of the strategies and techniques I have used in the past at several large companies and on high-profile projects to the needs of a very nimble startup like Argo.  I am relatively structured in communication and tend to use emails to highlight action items and bulleted lists of takeaways.  I have found that less effective here as people are multi-tasking to a very high degree and project directions change rapidly.  My personality is also one to observe before interjecting, and to try to not overload people.  This is a habit which can be effective in the right structure but in a more fast-paced environment can let projects stall.  I am working on improving how to keep items accelerating even in the face of conflicting priorities and high demand on the ICs being asked to execute the work.  I believe that many different personality types can bring something beneficial to these scenarios and I am working to incorporate my best habits with those I observe in my peers.

A couple project examples of this include the SW dev process doc and the Miami roadmap.  The SW dev process doc evolved from an engineering ask to codify some standards and getting review from an outside team, to establishing a common foundation _between_ the teams with formal leadership approval, and during this process the priority and engineer engagement varied.  This is an example where I could have utilized a different technique to keep the project going and to re-engage where necessary.

Similarly, with the Miami roadmap, compiling information was a complex ask of the teams during a time when other project planning was occurring, and due to this and the possibly duplicative nature of some of the ask I did not push on starting the discussions rapidly enough.  Even now, the ambiguity of some aspects of the event makes teams hesitant to define certain items at this stage, making assembly of a formal roadmap beyond Q2 challenging.  I am still learning strategies to conduct these conversations and acquire the necessary information in this context and am looking to peers with strength in this particular area for consultation.",,,Randy Schultheis,rschultheis@argo.ai,Randy Schultheis,rschultheis@argo.ai,Software,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Unbeknownst to Ray, he landed into Lion's Den with his the role as Program Manager for the Z1 Build. There were programmatic problems on the horizon for Z1, then before he got his bearings, Code Red happened and further took away Software and Operational Focus from Z1.

Ray was brought in to tackle this tough task and with just a few small changes, he could make an even larger impact on the program and org. 

Ray is a very quick learner and he's come up-to-speed rapidly on the technologies and plans for Argo's Z1 Build. He asks questions and pokes when he doesn't know the meaning of terms, milestones, and/or roles & responsibilities.  This inquisitive mindset is a great asset and I'm sure if he turned it up a notch he'd have an even greater impact on the Program and/or organization. For example, he could ask about what other meetings he could sit in on (e.g., a different 1x 30 min per week) or what documents would help him understand the software plan. There are a LOT of pieces that come together for this Z1 build and Ray is putting them together well. However, with just a little change he could seek our a holistic understanding, beyond what is required, and become a **driving force** to the program.

I'm very impressed with how well Ray works in 1-on-1 situations, e.g., by organizing regular syncs on my assigned tasks and ensure I'm accountable for those aspects. Yet, I'd like to challenge Ray to bring the whole Z1 program together and align as a team regularly. We have our weekly Program Review (which covers the entire Argo Program/Portfolio). However, Ray's leadership would shine if he organized a weekly Z1 Bring-Up sync with the relevant PMs & TPMs to align as a cross-functional program before the org-wide sync. This way, the we'd align on Z1 and then utilize the Program Review as an escalation medium and improve both his and the program teams impact on the organization. Ray could augment his strong 1-1 strengths by asserting himself as **the** program manager for the Z1 Bring-Up.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,manager,"Ray is still on the steep learning curve of the unique HW, HW owners and HW requirements for an AV. Him having a  good  knowledge of the HW will be critical when the Z1 builds and commissioning start in June. This knowledge will also help with projects that are not as well defined. I would suggest Ray continue to ask questions and meet with the Subject Matter Experts within Argo and Ford to help him get up to speed.

I feel Ray is frustrated with the lack of Ford management over the prototype builds. While I agree it is frustrating, there is a lot of opportunity for Ray to influence the process with his knowledge in building cars and I would suggest he consider finding ways to help them improve.

Part of being a program manager is being proactive, seeing the big picture, seeing what's missing and getting the project put together with the affected teams. In Dec, via R&R Doc, Ray was asked to work with Chris Attard to help facilitate completion of the Z1 commissioning plan. Ray didn't get started on it until March. Ray needed to be more proactive seeking out Chris Attard and helping him get the plan put together, key open issues identified and a plan put in place to facilitate to closure. 

As well, some of the more well defined tasks have taken longer than I would have expected to complete. The Z1 Spares Plan (which built on the Z0 plan) for the Logistics team is a more recent example. While the Ford contacts he reached out to failed to reply, I recommended a few other ways to get the information he needed to complete, but I’m not aware he took any action. I request Ray set completion dates, strive to meet them and elevate any issues in a timely fashion so as to still meet the deadline.",,,Tom Bloxsom,tbloxsom@argo.ai,Raymond Mann,rmann@argo.ai,Program Team,

For future projects, I would like to see Ray make more of an effort to use the project plans of other teams to determine deadlines for tasks. I often found that the deadlines for tasks were determined by finding the quickest possible deadline if everything was given priority and did not hit roadblocks, when it probably could have been balanced a bit better with other ongoing projects had we had a clearer understanding of the timeline needs of other teams, and driven deadlines that way.

I look forward to Ray's continued contributions as a TPM for the upcoming Z1 build.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"In addition to his upkeep of the traffic light tracking task, Reza has done a great job of collaborating with other teams on issues such as motion planning and AI to ensure the traffic light pipeline runs smoothly. He is often the first to volunteer to handle the ""popup"" bug solving issues when there's a report of something wrong with the traffic light pipeline. He has spent many long days diving into the code base and identifying the source of issues.

He has also always been agreeable in testing others' code on vehicle to ensure it runs correctly before it lands. His knowledge of the perception stack in combination with his first hand experience on vehicle has continually proven valuable, and will continue to be critical as we roll out new changes to the perception pipeline.

Finally, Reza showed flexibility in implementing updates to the traffic light visualization software. For example, he was able to put together multiple modifications to the motion planning team's viz plugin - one that did things the ""correct"" way of displaying the status based on the face relevant to motion planning (info that was not available yet), and one that used the closest face in front of the vehicle. Before Reza's changes, the plugin's visualization was broken, oscillating between all the faces in view.",,,Guy Hotson,ghotson@argo.ai,Reza Azimi,razimi@argo.ai,Software,

As a result, he has been the primary point of contact for traffic light questions for motion planning. As I've seen in various slack channels, he has clearly been one of the main points of contact for traffic lights in general. He very quickly jumps on on-vehicle issues to fix problems encountered during testing or fleet ops.

My experience working with Reza was primarily in November when we were working to integrate the published traffic light message into the motion planning stack so that we could handle traffic lights. Reza was very easy to communicate with during this period. One of the issues we needed to resolve was exactly what the interface was going to be. I had several productive conversations with Reza on slack about this issue and we ended up figuring out a good solution. Reza then implemented the final interface later in January and helped me understand how to adapt the MP code to use the new interface. Overall, Reza was very eager to help the MP team use the traffic light code and easy to work with. He was very helpful in debugging and is clearly very knowledgeable about his particular domain.
",,,Chris Cunningham,ccunningham@argo.ai,Reza Azimi,razimi@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Reza has been a great partner. The traffic light system and the map have matured together, and we've worked together mostly in popup fire-fighting. His attitude is great, he's been unfailingly supportive and understanding even when it was completely our fault, and cheerfully taking the hit when it's his own system. I know just how frustrating it is when you finally get everything perfect - and then it turns out the damn car can't see the traffic lights. (Sometimes it's the map, sometimes it's the code, sometimes it's rain on the lidar...) So in that situation Reza's willingness to pitch in has been very valuable.
Traffic lights seem like a problem with a relatively easy 80% solution, a ton of work for each increment after that, and simultaneously a rich enough set of data and infra dependencies that it's important to be robust as well as inventive. So far the system seems to be making good compromises between those conflicting goals.",,,Seth Porter,symmetry@argo.ai,Reza Azimi,razimi@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"**Notable Contributions and Organizational Impact:**

My main contribution has been in designing, implementing and integrating the Traffic Light (TL) pipeline. This has attributed to the code base and runs on the vehicle. Here are some of the main components that were done by me.

1) Mapping->TL Interface: This module includes the interface and the helper functions to retrieve TL information from the map. TL locations and associations are the main information provided my mapping. This module is responsible for retrieving and translating that information to be used through out the TL pipeline. 
(TrafficLightMapInterface, TrafficLightMapHelper)

2) Traffic Light State Tracker Task: This task uses the output of the TL Detection Task and generates the Traffic Light State Message to be used by MP. 

This module includes the usage of HMM filter (Discrete Bayesian) to smooth out the results of the TL detection. Here are the stages are involved in this effort. Creating and updating filters for each signal set and bulb type (circular vs. arrow), generating the Transition Matrix for all possible light states, Updating the filter based on the confidences of TL detection, and prediction of the posteriors. 

This posterior information and the mapping association information is then being used to generate the TrafficLightStateMessage. This message includes information regarding the state, status confidences and other information at bulb, subset and set levels. It is published under ""traffic_lights_state"" for MP usage. 
(TrafficLightStateTrackerTask, TrafficLightStateTrackerManager, TrafficLightsStateMessage)

3) TL->MP Interface: This module include the output channel of the TL pipeline (traffic_light_state) and post processing of the information embedded in these messages. The helper functions provide the information required by MP such as the state of the lights that MP is interested in. 
(TrafficLightInterface)

4) Visualization: Publishing on ""traffic_lights/tl_tracker_vis"" and displaying the TL bboxes. This is for our dev testing and debugging, as well as for providing the means for OPS team. For displaying the TL results in Argonaut, in addition to our TL bboxes, I have updated the 2D visualization icon. First method was picking the signal set closer to us and now switched to using the MP's trajectory debug messages and displaying the state of the light that MP is interested in. 

As a result, TL pipeline 1.0  has been successfully running on the vehicle, enabling MP's intersection behavior for traffic light managed cross-roads. 

Additionally Arrow handling structure is in the code base and will be evaluated. I also have been involved in designing the TL pipeline 2.0. I am responsible for the Tracker side.  have written the related design docs and participated in presenting them to the related teams. Flashing operation and independent subset-sensor tracking design docs are in the final stages and MVP implementation has started. 

**Communication and Team Work**

The success was achieved by close co-operation within the TL team and the Mapping and MP teams. Being involved in designing the TL pipeline, I have been able to communicate our requirements to our providers and also understand the needs of our clients.  

Mapping: I have been there to test offline and on vehicle whenever a new map was published (Pittsburgh and Dearborn) to help and make sure of the validity of TLs (location, bulb-subset-set-face associations). I also worked closely with Mapping team for Pittsburgh demo to make sure correct lights are in the map. Worked closely with Meredith, Seth, Dan, Patrick and Jessica to provide support when needed. These folks have been amazing in providing and enabling our TL pipeline. 

MP: This effort was mainly in November and December. We had brainstorming with Chris, Tom and Al to design the TL->MP interface. Understanding their needs, designing and then implementing the TL output signal, interface and then helper functions were what I did on that front. MP has been great in communicating and also supporting me. Cheers to Tom and Chris.

AI: I have addressed issues reported by AI in a timely manner. Worked closely with Joho and Dale when there were TL concerns, have done debugging and provided solutions or redirected to appropriate teams. They have done a great job in validating these solutions and helping with debugging and providing the specifics of any failures. 

At the end of the day this is a team effort and I could have not achieved the above, without the help of many many amazing and intelligent people in various teams (Vehicle Ops, Mapping, MP, AI). Perception team (ML & PI) have been always there on supporting and brainstorming and it has been a pleasure to build the TL pipeline from scratch with Guy under Guillaume's supervision, and now expanding it and taking it to the next level with new smart and very capable manager and team members, Ersin and Richard.

**Leadership**
I have been a go-to person for TL related questions. When other teams needed better understanding on the TL pipeline functionality (for example functional safety) or when there has been issues related to TL (online and offline), I have been a point of contact. 

Used only 9 days of my Paternity Leave to come back and help in times of the Red Code crises. I fixed the error handling for TL related tasks and other TL classes, while @ghoston did an amazing job on the diagnostic signals. I was in Pittsburgh for a week before the demo. While had a PTO for a Friday, not only did not use it but my work continued through that weekend to make sure demo goes smooth and TL does not let the Argo team down. 

I have been quick on jumping in the car (after offline testing), not only for my code/dev testing but also for ML needs specially since our team in California does not have vehicles yet. I have been happy to provide support to Argo team members, helping with reviewing, debugging and testing their developments. I have also guided team members in Dearborn on deploying code and testing on vehicles.

Finally, in addition to my educational background and work experience in the AV related domains, as the evidence provided above, I believe that I have had a substantial impact on our company and team. I have worked hard and delivered for months without any gap at the higher level and am ready to continue to improve and have more significant impact on the success of our company, this time as a Senior Engineer.",,,Reza Azimi,razimi@argo.ai,Reza Azimi,razimi@argo.ai,Software,

We decided to remove that source and just use the ring camera while debugging the issue. What we did not think of was how this affects the system as a whole. As this decreased our detection range, Motion Planning was affected on their reasoning for intersection behavior.

- Significantly improved the performance of the traffic light classifier during the March 29 demo push.  Substantially increasing the amount of data that we had labeled even though we struggled with missing lights in the map up to a few days before the demo. Performance of the classifier on the demo route met expectations except for the edge case with the green building.
- Pushed for more automated ways to extract traffic light label data and was able to use AWS to scale out the extraction to ~20 drives per week.  Also used parquet logs to more efficiently find logs with traffic lights.  Supplied data to the labeling team for ~1.5 months on a weekly basis.

- Wrote code to train models on aetros and was able to use this to scale out training to 10 instances in parallel.
- Improved understanding of python 3 and typing and was able to get python readership.

o	Conducted on-going monthly financial reviews with senior leadership, providing insights 
into long-term cash spending, highlighting changes in Argo’s operating environment and resulting financial impact vs. prior forecasts.  Raised potential operating concerns with respect to significant changes in the underlying business, identifying both long-term risks and opportunities, prompting key follow-up discussions between functional leads and senior management.  

o	Overhauled long-term P&L forecast model to reflect key changes in on-going business operations, including Compensation, Headcount, R&D, Facilities, IT, and VO cost trajectories.  Additionally, completed on-going Argo Board level financial P&L updates incl. 5-year cash flow funding requirement updates.

o	Coordinated P&L deep dives with budget owners and budget finance manager to understand and flow through appropriate changes in operating cost profile and forecast assumptions.  Provided guidance to operating partners in managing long-term spend trajectories, advocating and testing for reasonable (and fairly represented) cost planning assumptions, avoiding both overly aggressive and conservative forecasts. 


2) Equity Planning & Management:

o	Facilitated completion of Argo’s updated equity valuation (post-PLI acquisition) with a new third-party valuation service provider (Houlihan Lokey), enabling Argo to continue to grant equity to new hires and meet regulatory and tax requirements (per IRC Section 409A).  Prepared Argo management overviews, outlining key changes in methodology vs. prior service provider, and summarizing overall impact to Argo’s company valuation.  Closed out differences in opinion between valuation service provider (Houlihan Lokey) and independent auditor (PwC) to finalize the 409A valuation.

o	Presented recommendations to senior leadership regarding equity management strategy for both short and long-term, evaluating different equity award types (outlining Pros and Cons of each award), including summary of tax implications and trade-offs between Argo and Employees.  Proposal led to approved equity planning strategy in 2018.  

o	Created 5-year equity forecast to assist management with equity planning, collaborated with Recruiting to revise offering strategy with new hires, and created quarterly compensation equity forecast to support Argo finance team’s accounting and financial statement reporting requirements.

o	Managed employee equity issuance, tracking, and communication notices (including online platform distributions via Carta) for Equity Lot 7 and 8, coordinating with People Ops to facilitate equity distributions, forfeitures, employee support, and other notices (e.g. 83(b) filing notices).


3) Business Development Initiatives -- Goods Delivery & OEM 2:

o	Collaborated with Strategy and Business Development to study non-TaaS AV market opportunities, providing financial analysis and strategic considerations around potential market opportunities.  Met with operating teams to understand engineering challenges and constraints, establishing vehicle and VDS parameters, operating domain, headcount requirements, and other key success factors necessary support a viable Goods Delivery vehicle platform.  

o	Developed comprehensive ground-up financial models to evaluate AV market opportunities and identify business models that provide highly attractive profit returns incremental to Argo’s TaaS business.  Utilized sensitivity analysis and scenario planning tools to assess business model risks (downside) and opportunities (upside) given changes in underlying economics and operating structure (e.g. market sizing, pricing, cost structure, operating environment and assumptions).  

o	Work collaboration resulted in recommending strategic paths in Goods delivery for Argo to pursue and gain leadership team's “buy-in” and support to further progress business development activities.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Rob is good at piecing together and understanding unknown, complex information. For example, Rob owns the 10 year plan for Argo which especially at such an early life stage has a lot of unknowns and requires well defined assumptions to be able to tie back to version changes as we quickly iterate. Additionally, Rob developed an equity model for a complicated equity plan which he explained to our finance team in a digestible way for us with little understanding of the equity structure and what considerations go into selection of the structure. Finally, he built out a forecast for equity that I use in my current year forecasts (very helpful).",,,Jen DeBrincat,jdebrincat@argo.ai,Rob Park,rpark@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Rob is an outstanding colleague and a key member of the ""Strat-Fi"" team. Over the past six months, I have worked closely with Rob on a number of joint Strategy-Finance projects, and he has done an excellent job across the board. A few such projects include: 

- **Goods Delivery** - Rob drove the bulk of the modeling work, setting up the main model, integrating our assumptions with Anne's (our external consultant), and thoughtfully structuring and segmenting assumption inputs. Moreover, Rob skillfully managed the numerous scenarios we considered, producing multiple output charts/graphs that clearly articulated key trends and messages. Multiple 
- **Project Saturn** - Rob was a key contributor to a presentation for Project Saturn, a potential second OEM partner, which we had to turn around on an accelerated timeframe. For this analysis, Rob did an excellent job in putting together a view on operating margin economics for a potential AV business, benchmarking it against the economics of a traditional vehicle platform. Rob's insight into how OEMs measure and analyze profitability was key, allowing us to create a compelling analysis that compared metrics with which traditional OEMs would be familiar. 
- **Business Plan P&L Updates** - Rob has been instrumental in driving updates to our P&L model. Earlier this year, I worked closely with Rob to update our city-rollout schedule and assumptions on our operating area coverage within each metro area. As part of this exercise, Rob instituted an excellent way to model our geofence expansion over time. More recently, we have been working to update our market and cost assumptions, as well as modeling the effect of a second OEM partner. Rob has been key in helping drive these efforts, providing sound analysis and modeling of various scenarios and outcomes.

Over the past six months, Rob had a meaningful impact on the ""Strat-Fi"" team. From a strategy perspective, Rob has become a trusted partner, helping us model and understand the financial implications of various strategic initiatives. His modeling mechanics are superb, and he has great attention to detail. I can always count on Rob to whiteboard and bounce ideas off of, and he consistently provides thoughtful analysis and ideas. His background with Ford has also been very helpful, providing insight into how our Ford counterparts think about certain strategic and financial approaches. 

Rob is also a pleasure to work with. He is affable, approachable, and reliable. He is very responsive: whether late at night or on a weekend, I can count on Rob to be available and ready to discuss, analyze, and drive any deliverables we may have.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"As we began to accumulate more auto miles 2018, it's natural the number of issues observed in the vehicle began to mount. Rob took it upon himself to begin tracking those issues so that we can have somewhat of an idea as to which vehicles are having particular issues.  This is no easy task considering we don't have the proper tooling to easily track.  His spreadsheet tracker of issues has helped us to find vehicles specific issues that we once thought were software issues.  It has also helped us determine the best vehicles to use for important demos the past few months.  

Rob has slowly taken on more and more responsibility within the department.  Not only is he the overseer of the VSR board, but he has also taken on the main PoC role for Viz Tool requests for VehicleOps. His continued relationships with leads and members of other teams have enabled him to push some of our important requests to the top of the queue.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"At a startup, having a roughly defined job description is both a blessing and a challenge. This makes it very difficult to measure or quantify the results and impact of your day to day work, but I enjoy this environment as it allows the freedom and opportunity to have many small yet broad influences on the organization as a whole. A common theme has formed in my daily efforts and that is to continuously evaluate and improve the flow of communication within VehOps and between VehOps and the rest of the organization. This can roughly be compartmentalized into a few categories below.

The standup, oversight, and persistent iteration of the VSR/VMR process across the organization and integration with Fleetio to keep track of fleet platform issues, AV system issues, vehicle modifications, fleetwide updates, and real time vehicle status. This is currently used as a foundation for all Fleet, Service, and Testing Operations. It has been my intention to maintain a very tight communication loop surrounding issues reported from the Fleet to the appropriate personnel. At the stage we are in, continual improvement to processes are needed due to the high rate of personnel growth, mileage accumulation, and AV system performance. 

As the primary channel through which most fleet issues flow, I have started building relationships and processes to allow better communication with Ford. The partnership between Ford and Argo is very dynamic and it is exciting to see the commitment and support we have so far. But the reality remains that we are very different organizations and conduct business in a very different way. This leaves continual opportunity for improvement in our communication channels as roles and responsibilities continue to shift.  

I have also made a consolidated effort to focus and accelerate the development of FleetOps VIZ tools by unifying and organizing feedback from across VehOps management and team leads. This has been done through several design meetings and continual dialogue as team needs and operating environments change. I have scheduled reoccurring sync meetings with VIZ management and TPMs to ensure goals and future needs are being met and priorities are regularly reassessed. So far, this has included improvements to the layout, performance, logger plugin, diagnostic system, auto annotations, and development of a dedicated MapQA tool. 

SW diagnostics and triage tooling has been an ongoing project for me since really the beginning. The need for these types of tools has been increasing rapidly and will only continue to grow exponentially into Z1. I have been working with people from many different areas of the organization including TPM, AutoInt, Offboard, Infrastructure, Visualization, and Motion Planning to start to expose the importance and working together to draft the design of some of these tools and build a vision for the future of Argo. I feel this will eventually be the channel through which nearly all critical information will pass and be managed across many cities and countless vehicles. 

The relationships and reputation I have built working on these projects and many more have allowed me the opportunity of guiding several indirect reports and establish myself as leader within VehOps. I have also been given the invitation to attend the daily executive standup review in which the state of the company and performance of our system is discussed and evaluated. I have the opportunity to not only be a voice for VehOps, but also provide suggestions and feedback to the direction of our system and processes. I am excited to continue to grow my responsibilities and start to manage a direct team of my own. As Argo continues to grow I am hopeful for an opportunity for more of a senior leadership role and continue to lead a world class team.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Rob and I worked together on the planning of the Argonaut visualization tools improvements for FleetOps.  Rob has been an integral part of the viz team having a cohesive plan for the improvement of Argonaut.  Prior to Rob joining the team, requests for Argonaut improvements would come from multiple different points and would go to either the viz lead or myself via email, slack, personal conversation.  It was hard to keep the request list straight and in any type of prioritized order.  Rob came in, took charge of gathering all of the requests internally within FleetOps, and came to us with a unified vision of what the FleetOps version of Argonaut should look like.  Together we took that vision prioritized and were able to come up with a plan for improvement.  While this longer term project continues, Rob helps us continually prioritize and filter the requests coming into the Viz team for FleetOps Argonaut.

Additionally, Rob has also been awesome to work with through out the whole process.  He is responsive, easy to communicate with, and always a pleasure to talk to.

During my 1:1's with the VO I's about a month back, I always like to ask them ""what's the worst part of your job?"" or ""what makes your job suck?"".  Everyone of the VO I's said keeping your tracker up to date is the biggest pain point for them.  As you know, we are extremely tooling deficient right now.  VO I's have to schedule (using Google sheets), constantly monitor the VTR board for requests, monitor Slack for request on Ops, handle in person vehicle requests, setup employee ride alongs on a google sheet, update the VO tardiness tracker when VO's are late, monitor your spreadsheet/fleetio to see which vehicles are functional, and handle in-vehicle troubleshooting on Slack. As highlighted above, their day consists of multiple Google sheets, Jira, Slack, and Fleetio.  It's one thing if they could schedule and be done with it, but their job is non-stop to the point where some of them don't even leave their desks at lunch. I completely understand your request to have them populate your tracker with the issues, but their workload continues to increase without better solutions in the short term horizon.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"My biggest accomplishment has been having a way to document vehicle utilization throughout the Z0 fleet.  Using Fleetio, there was a way for the VOs, to more accurately than before, document their specific time and distance usage.  This has also extended to our developers that enter the vehicles for static testing through documentation as well.  This plan has finally found the legs to be extended to Dearborn and Miami as well.  This encompasses our driving fleet.  Joe Serbin and I also maintain a google site that quickly displays the information gathered using a series of graphs to show how our fleet is being utilized.  

The other major thing I have helped with is our ingest process.  This has helped ease the workload off of Mat Priest and allowed him to be able to focus on other things.  Through all of this I also suggested an implementation of each vehicle using multiple bricks throughout the day to allow for a more seamless transition for our triage team to be getting our data more efficiently.  Unfortunately, this has resulted in some backlog of ingesting creating longer days.  But, I have focused on making sure that is covered through long night efforts to make sure our data situation is not compromised.  

My ability to quickly be able to help run shift helped with our progress towards the demo and making sure that our fleet had support when Nuk and Dave were asked to go with Devs because I was not yet certified.  This transition was made easier with the confidence everyone helped to instill in me as I learned.   

The helping with the training of Dan and Marlon was another thing that happened, specifically with training them up on ingest.  But there were also multiple conversations to help them understand the expectations we have and why exceeding those expectations is important.  Seeing those two develop throughout the 6 weeks was heartening, especially watching them take on the roles they had been taught only weeks before.

The support he can and does provide is great for making our team more agile and flexible.

Ryan has almost completely taken on the process of ingesting data bricks.  Many times, Ryan has stayed in the office very late to ensure we would have enough data bricks to keep plugging away on the pavement the next day, as well as the rest of the week.  This is something that could easily be overlooked, as most of us are gone while he continues to ingest bricks and document accordingly.  The impact of this is huge though.  Not only does this help us get cars onto the road, this also helps triage receive the data they're wanting much quicker.  Really it comes down to - if we don't have data bricks available, we can't run our vehicles.  Thus, we are unable to make progress towards our goal(s).  Immensely impactful responsibility.

Ryan also helped to train our Miami VO I's on different aspects of the job and the industry.  One of the things that it was important for them to learn was the process of ingest.  Through the training of Ryan (and Mat Priest) - Dan and Marlon are able to properly ingest data bricks in Miami to allow for cars to be on the road consistently, day after day.

More recently, Ryan was also tasked with developing a way to efficiently and more accurately track our vehicle utilization.  Through collaboration with Joe Serbin - he was able to use Fleetio as a means to be able to accomplish this.  This has also become multi-city based, so the process is a standard part of the checklist, prior to signing off on your pre-shift inspection and post shift inspection.

Ryan has adapted quickly, and his previous knowledge of the industry has made for seamless integration and acclimation with not only our team, but the entire operation.  Another great addition to our team.",,,Anuruk Buranathanit,aburanathanit@argo.ai,Ryan Schiffour,rschiffour@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Ryan has a fun personality but as a (younger) lead I feel Ryan may need to show more maturity to demand the lead (manager) role and have VO's take him more seriously. 

Ryan has great experience in this industry and can take all his experience and make ARGO the best of all he has experienced. 

I think Ryan can push the other leads to make sure a better job is done to have a consistent EOS time. When I am in the vehicles the one thing the VO's tell me is the inconsistent end of day times is one thing they do not appreciate. I know its hard to bring the fleet in, clean the cars and do the brief in a time limit but it is important the VO's have a consistent time they go home.

If you get more regular experience I feel that you could better contribute to finding fleet inefficiencies and solving them with your great attention to detail and methodical thought process.  You are quick to learn and pick up on issues that others may not see, and this could help to positively impact utilization and gain greater hands-on insight into what you're working on tracking.",,,Steven Swartz,sswartz@argo.ai,Ryan Schiffour,rschiffour@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"Biggest areas of improvement are going to be in making sure to be more involved.  If there is something that happens before I enter the office for the day, I sometimes will allow myself to get caught in being behind and not getting completely caught up.  

Have not gotten into the vehicles as much as possible.  There have been periods of time where I have only forced myself into a car about once or trice per week.  

Can have some issues with focus when there is downtime, specifically on things after shift has ended.  There is more that I could be doing to make sure things are getting done.  This causes somethings to end up getting postponed for a day unnecessarily.  

When distributing my project to track utilization, it was delivered in broken pieces and as such was met with mixed results early on due to the lack of information I was giving in the beginning.  This caused for a delay in the delivering of good, high quality data.  It also led to confusion for the individuals that were being asked to continuously fill out the information.  ",,,Ryan Schiffour,rschiffour@argo.ai,Ryan Schiffour,rschiffour@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"When Ryan initially rolled out his utilization project - there was still some uncertainty on some parts of the procedure.  This unfortunately was causing breakdowns in the data that he was receiving.  He was getting incomplete vehicle assignments in Fleetio, which was in part, due to communication of the project in it's entirety.  We ended up needing to review the process with the operators multiple times to be able to convey to them what was needed, and how it was to be entered correctly.  Confusion was causing skewed data as far as utilization goes, so the data would have, effectively, become unreliable had the confusion not been dispelled.  

At times, I know it can be hard for Ryan to stay focused - in particular, when it gets into the latter part of his shift (evening).  It's easier then to lose track of what is priority or what needs done.  Consequently, it's possible some tasks may be delayed in their completion time.  This is more of something Ryan has discussed with me previously, but have also observed too.",,,Anuruk Buranathanit,aburanathanit@argo.ai,Ryan Schiffour,rschiffour@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,

I am the same type of person, and I know it took me plenty of practice to find a fine line to balance with this when managing others.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"It’s common, on an everyday basis, to coordinate and interact with my fellow co-workers. It’s common to find me moving full-sized desks, assist in planning events or help find vendors, signing for packages, and occasionally watching the door for interviewees and interact with them when necessary. Since our office has multiple departments with very limited resources within the second biggest and fastest growing Argo office in the country, resources and individual bandwidth will indeed spread thin. As a result, those who fall under the departments with limited resources have naturally learned to collaborate and assist each other whenever needed. We’ve also learned to greatly appreciate each other in the process. Bandwidth has been a consistent topic through my 6 month Argo career, so finding time to do other tasks outside my core duties during the work day has been challenging, but it hasn’t stopped me at all. Yes, Argo currently takes a good portion of my professional and personal time. 

An example of this work ethic can be traced back to day one. I entered the Argo workforce, and after I had established an IT presence, I requested to speak to an array of individuals in different departments to see if I could help them with tasks outside the scope of my core duties. For example, the very first week I had talked to Josh Smith and he had tasked me to administer the Crystal Server which was experiencing an assortment of issues  - prior to its installation onto the sensor bench. Today, I haven’t stopped and continue to offer my assistance, advice, and ideas; I'd also provide demos and solutions for such ideas. I continue to develop applications, create automative scripts, and engaged in projects outside my general support scope. I have gained the trust of many Argo employees and managers due to my quick response time for technical and non-technical issues, and efficient implementation of technical solutions.

I believe I have gone greatly outside the scope of a general support role, and even strongly believe, based on my past experience and current tasks I’ve been doing till this day, I'm currently standing on the front door of engineering. Based on the go/levels, I have proven that I have a solid understanding of technologies, technological and development processes, and strong understanding of development tools. I have shown I can implement automatic processes and successfully execute all aspects of both front-end and back-end application development. I’m able to design and plan efficient and scalable data flows and write code while keeping in mind its scalability, compatibility and UX. I’m comfortable with an array of DevOps tools, such as puppet, salt, jenkins, nagios, logcheck, docker, AWS and more, as well as, testing tools, such as Selenium. I have utilized some of these tools in my toolbox to more efficiently do menial tasks in order to create more bandwidth for myself. Such as, create test cases using selenium to properly test the in-house applications I have developed, I've also developed a quick support tool with fixes for every issue I have encounter in my support role in order to be more efficient when troubleshooting helpdesk related tasks, in turn, this also helps free up more bandwidth. I am ambitious and have proven my capabilities in more ways than one, and believe I need a re-analysis of my current position. Here are a list of the core responsibilities I had originally been tasked when hired under this role:

Official Role Task List:
- Linux knowledge is a MUST.  Ubuntu and Red Hat preferred
- Provide help desk service to all users of the local site predominantly Linux driven
- Experience with Windows and Mac OS as well
- Experience providing break fix support for both hardware and software applications on all PC’s and laptops running Ubuntu Linux
- Installation and upgrade of various software applications via desk side and remote support tools
- Provide printing support for all users in local site

Here’s a list of everything else I’ve been doing outside my Core Responsibilities:

All large office projects - All things related to the 150 move, galaxy installation and configuration, guided badging solutions and installations, zoom installation coordination, guided camera and security installations, and more.

Testing and QA

- Testing on multiple systems:Galaxy, badging, servers, 
- QA testing on in-house applications
- Developing test cases using selenium to run expected use cases for Hims application
- Ensured network stability in 150 prior to move in
monitored badging logs and provided fixes appropriately

Project Development

- Execute collaboration between Argo teams in regards to planning and scope of project
- Collaborate amongst team and provide feedback on current projects
- Conduct presentations for tools suggested as solutions to other department problems

Application Development

- Engineer front-end web UI for Hardware Interface Application
- Develop automated scripts that pulls changes in hardware configurations 
- Deployed Hardware Interface Application created as a check-in /check out borrowing system as well as a asset management tool
- Engineered an array of multiple scalable back-end systems
- Continued maintenance, bug fixing, feature development on all applications developed
- Conducted full deployment of applications from the ground up
- Designed data flow charts and executed db schema based off charts.
- Automated data ingest using certain API's
- Full prod environment deployment and configuration, such as the installation and configuration of all the following tools: Ruby on Rails, Apache2, Passenger, mysql, and all other package dependencies. 

IT
- Administered MTV ingest server for local issues
- Administered crystal server prior to deployment on the bench server
- Installed multiple server equipments such as the ingest server, UPS, NAS, as well as repatched entire 150 networking closet
- Quickly established an IT presence within an IT-less location
- Established regulations within the MTV office based on Pitt standards
- DB schema research
- PCIE tracking research
- Full Inventory organization
- Quickly bring IT infrastructure to company standards 
- Administer accounts on multiple applications
- Automated common it installation tasks (prior to the official roll out)

Team Player and Assisted tasks:

- Assist with physical move between 150 and 100 on multiple occasions
- Successfully communicate and assist other argo employees with tasks outside the IT realm
- Assisted with assembling the first sensor bench
- Coordinated with 3rd party companies to create quick solutions that meet argo standards. 
- Signed for packages and delivered the packages.
- Shipped packages (prior to Quang)
- Clean zoom rooms, re-organize zoom rooms, open shades, help move non IT equipment and packages between the two offices, and any other tasks requested by others with limited resources. 

I’ve always been open to feedback, but also not afraid to provide feedback on issues I feel could negatively affect the company. 
For example: Requesting to attend meetings for IT projects that can affect the company on a global scale in order to prevent possible issues that can occur, specifically possible issues unique to each argo office. Requesting to develop a support page for all common break/fixes that the company can access, in order to increase productivity and reduce the risk of further damage due to end user using unorthodox methods to fix the issue. I've been entrusted with the freedom to make particular calls that I felt would best fix particular emergent issues, and also have provided solutions for larger problems - both can potentially have affect the MTV office/company as a whole, but also proved that I have the knowledge to know when to escalate particular issues that requires assistance outside the realm of my current position.

Having his support has made a huge impact in taking IT work off the shoulders of Cynthia, Ming, Yee, and me. RJ basically makes everything IT work behind the scenes in the Argo office without the Mountain View leadership needing to worry about anything. Our network is stable. Our Zoom rooms generally work. New staff get the equipment they need. We receive immediate support when computers fail. 

RJ has even created some tools for my team to track AVS samples and he helped with our sensor benches. I appreciate having IT staff who go beyond the call of duty to help wherever they can.",,,Wes Ford,wford@argo.ai,Ryan Tiglao,rtiglao@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"RJ is by all means a team player, and what I would think of as one of the most invaluable additions to team Argo that I've had the pleasure of working alongside with. Everything that RJ writes in his own personal review reflects truth, and I believe that the sheer detail that he's gone into is a great representation of how much work he does, and just how much he continuously offers his help to everyone. 
I really appreciated all of his help and assistance in getting building 150 set up with me, along with helping make sure that everyone had their items properly prepared and marked to be moved to their new desks. Overall, RJ was a huge help in the moving process, and continues to be a great and reliable colleague. Of course, his assistance didn't just end at the move, but continued to be a continuous attribute throughout the past quarter where we work together to make sure that everything is functioning as best as possible in our building and facilities for the employees that work here. If I need his help with Zoom, he's there to help take care of it, and if I need his help in getting desks and cables set up, he's there as well. I know that if I need him to take care of something, he'll do it in a timely and efficient manner. This goes a long way to helping me make sure that we can function efficiently as an ops team to support the MTV office. 
I don't hesitate to say that RJ embodies what I feel Argo culture is about - from the great work ethic, to the readiness that he shows to help anyone at anytime, he is dependable and available whenever people need him, and a LOT of people need his help everyday. ",,,Yee Su,ysu@argo.ai,Ryan Tiglao,rtiglao@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"What are some specific accomplishments, projects, and results that this person drove during the review cycle timeframe?

I've worked with RJ as part of our lean mean ops team machine since his first day. RJ has adapted to the Argo startup ""firehose"" lifestyle where from day one, you will juggle tasks that stretch far beyond your core responsibilities. What is most visible to me is how he has become an all encompassing resource for our office. It wasn't clear to me at first what his role was exactly, but his enthusiasm for helping where ever needed was demonstrated from his very first day. It was clear that he was willing to fill any gaps as we continued to grow in Mountain View. 

What stands out to me the most is how he handled the badging system failures in the MTV office. The office went through many efforts to have a properly functioning badging system sent in from Pittsburgh that worked for MTV 100 and MTV 150. There were unforeseen issues with this system and RJ responded really well, under a lot of pressure along with his other ongoing projects to see the office through these difficulties. 

What are areas where this person has grown and made improvements? 
RJ has made a lot of efforts to communicate his projects amongst the MTV ops team and prioritize what needs to be done in order be efficient. He creates appropriate boundaries in order to get his projects completed. 

Think about not only results, but also about how this person collaborates and works with others.

RJ collaborates at any level to get the job done. I truly appreciate his willingness and positive attitude to help where ever needed. There are many details and projects that need a helping hand and RJ is always willing to chip in. He doesn't view it as a personal achievement and perhaps may think that it goes unnoticed. I think it speaks volumes of his work ethic and character. ",,,Lorena Villegas,lvillegas@argo.ai,Ryan Tiglao,rtiglao@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"RJ has transformed the bay area's technical workflow into a transparent operation. Since he joined, everything just worked. The Mountain View office used to only have 8 conference rooms which would require a lot of work to maintain. Even though the office has around 20 conference rooms across two buildings now, it is pretty rare that one has issues. RJ checks all the rooms every morning and I often see him stopping by other buildings at night right before he leaves. Zoom servers seem to have more issues than our rooms now. The same applies to the security systems and new buildings that are being set up. I see RJ working weekends and late nights to make sure all the systems are functional.

In addition to maintaining conference rooms, RJ did a great job at supporting our individual workflows. When something like a license server went down, RJ immediately reached out to the IT employees maintaining the switches and servers and resolved the issue. When Shaohui was not able to log into his computer late one night, RJ offered to drive in to help. RJ always puts the _support_ part of his role as a priority over all other projects. When somebody has a question, needs a port activated, needs a cable, needs a piece of equipment, etc, RJ always stops what he is doing to support that individual. This enables the entire office to work efficiently and without any breaks in workflow. Since our office is in a different time zone and location, RJ could work even more efficiently by having more authority over local switches and other hardware so he can activate and configure ports as needed. 

RJ is enthusiastic about continually learning, which has proved to make him a great asset to the office. When RJ started, for example, he was not too familiar with the intricacies of Linux. Had I not been a part of his interview panel, I would not have known this. He quickly educated himself and was able to provide adequate support around the office while helping put together many Linux machines for specialized development purposes. 


In addition to general IT support, RJ has supported me by taking on additional specialized projects:

My team is deploying raspberry pi's with each development AVS, and RJ taught us about a few different remote management tools that will greatly simplify managing, tacking, and accessing each pi. He is setting up a node master on a virtual machine and helping us deploy to the pi's. 

I was previously in charge of setting up ingest server hardware in the bay area. RJ completely off-loaded my task by interfacing directly with Wen (the software engineer who used the ingest server) to resolve issues when they appeared. I was able to focus completely on more pressing tasks.

RJ is currently working on 2 software projects to support my team's development efforts. One is a hardware tracker database which will permit us to track where all of our custom development hardware is, as well as any changes/reworks that we have made. This project will help us greatly while we wait for a professional hardware tracking system software to be configured for the long run. 
RJ is also building software to display sensor bench and/or vehicle information on a portable raspberry pi with a touch screen. As the fleet grows, this software will be incredibly helpful for quickly diagnosing vehicle issues, controlling the compute system, quickly logging data, etc. ",,,Josh Smith,jsmith@argo.ai,Ryan Tiglao,rtiglao@argo.ai,General & Administrative,

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"I think if RJ had a junior person to work with to handle smaller tasks, he would be able to spend more time on his current projects with more ease. Currently, its difficult to set those boundaries around projects and deadlines when there are many needs within the office, often times needs that are unforeseen and requested by the staff. 

If there were a junior person to help him, you would experience a more visible RJ executing much larger projects. ",,,Lorena Villegas,lvillegas@argo.ai,Ryan Tiglao,rtiglao@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"I encourage RJ to look for opportunities to expedite IT delays that hamper employee’s lives in Mountain View. For example, we had months of challenges with badge readers in the California office, and for a period many engineers had no badge access to their own office during off hours. I don’t actually know what was happening behind the scenes to cause these delays, but I encourage RJ to look for opportunities to expedite, simplify, escalate, and do whatever else is necessary to unblock projects that get bogged down.",,,Wes Ford,wford@argo.ai,Ryan Tiglao,rtiglao@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Note that this has nothing to do with core IT responsibilities, which RJ did a phenomenal job with:

When building software packages with a UI, it might be beneficial to build up the functionality of the software before creating a cleaned up UI. Even before creating a UI or having the final tools/servers in place, implementing and testing the low level features on a dev machine could yield quicker development times. It can also potentially permit software to be used sooner, while the UI is in development.",,,Josh Smith,jsmith@argo.ai,Ryan Tiglao,rtiglao@argo.ai,General & Administrative,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"I will continue to provide top technical support in order to provide as little downtime or disruption to those within my office, but my ultimate goal within this company is to continue to improve my skills in development operations and to learn from the best in this field. I’m an advocate for asking questions, and learning. I'll continue to initiate projects and jump on opportunities in relation to this field, projects that can still greatly support our engineers, while still improving the skills I aim to master. In a sense, I am providing support through applications and automation that can help individuals do their work more efficiently. I have more room to grow in this field. I will continue to push and acquire the knowledge gathered within this office, and continue to work on projects and tasks that are way above my current helpdesk role even if I have to work nights and weekends to do so - considering the little bandwidth i have during the weekday. My goal is to grow and improve in all aspects of my technical career, and I still believe that this is the best place to do it.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"I think that the biggest difficult that RJ faces is the sheer amount of work and tasks that he has to do on a daily basis, coupled with the tickets and requests that are thrown his way. With all of these deliverables expected of him, it's tough to stay on top of everything from what I can see. From small post-it notes here and there, along with digital trackers for himself, the list of items to complete just goes on and on, and I think that RJ simply has too many things going on at times. This has caused him to miss some deadlines related to the application that he was creating for onboarding. I don't think that his shortcomings derived form a lack of knowledge to perform the work that was required of him, but simply just from a lack of both time and resources. Being our only IT person, there's so much work that needs to be done before he can even begin working on personal projects. I think that RJ needs to fine tune what he can reasonably take on versus what he needs to take on in regards to his daily duties and tasks. There's also a balance of deciding on what he wants to take on versus what he can reasonably accomplish in a work day and work week. Knowing RJ, he's putting in more hours than he should be for a good work-life balance, and I'd like to see him take a little bit more time for himself instead of spending so much time trying to do so many things!

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Since the last review cycle, I've accomplished the following that lays out my case for promotion from a Level 3 SWE to Level 4

*Knowledge & Technical Skill*

I created the MVP implementations of the Traffic Light Selector and Traffic Signal Face Labeler application utilizing TypeScript with React, Redux, & Enzyme.  These were the first applications within the organization to use TypeScript. The Traffic Light Selector is used by Labeling & Mapping Production members for selecting frames within a log that contain traffic signal faces, for the purpose of labeling them with the Traffic Signal Face Labeler tool.

I successfully designed, developed and released the Argo Web Generator (AWG). The Argo Web Generator is a Yeoman based application that allows any developer within the organization wishing to spin up a React/TypeScript application effortlessly (with includes Argo specific scripts/configurations).  The decision to develop this tool was driven by a need to spin up non-Single Page Applications quickly within the LME team.  However, since then I've expanded the tool to also generate individual libraries as well due to the need to create smaller components to share between the LME codebase became needed.  Since its creation, the AWG has been used by both LME and the Triage team to spin up Argo View, LME backend/frontend interface libraries, Homer (depot-tools), Sherlock's Frontend, & lme-auth and has significantly cut down on code review times for initial application spin up.

In order to facilitate the usage of authentication in other LME based applications, I led the initiative to separate the LME Authentication code from Operator Management.  In order to ensure reusability, the authentication code was placed in a separate library and deployed to Artifactory (rather than living adjacent to the Operator Management codebase). As a part of this effort, I developed a way to download the google authentication (gapi) library (which is not distributed via NPM) when the module is loaded to facilitate ease of use.  The code for the library was also converted to TypeScript to better define the contracts between applications wishing to use the library.  As a result of this effort, the teams (LABELING AND MAPTOOLS) can begin to adopt the authentication library, which will aid in auditing map production edits with respect to which production team member made which edits.

Upon splitting the LME team into three subteams, one of the items that was absent from the MAPTOOLS applications was the ability to run tests.  I took on the initiative of adding the proper infrastructure within our Jenkins build file and each application itself in order to unblock myself and my peers from writing tests.  In addition to adding infrastructure, I also added initial testing to each application in order to ensure that the infrastructure put in place worked as intended and to get some initial coverage around our applications.

In this past review cycle, I've made the done the following in order to connect with the technical community :
- Attended TSConf, the first TypeScript conference.  The conference was attended by other engineers at companies using the language (including employees from MicroSoft, Lyft, Amazon, & LucidCharts).
- Successfully submitted a talk to PghTechFest, a technology conference in Pittsburgh.  I'll be presenting 'Scaling JavaScript Applications with TypeScript' in early June.
- Begun to contribute to the TSLint project on my own time.  TSLint is an open source project that is the defacto linting tool for the TypeScript language.  In this review cycle I’ve had 4 PRs successfully merged into the codebase.

*Organizational Impact*

I introduced TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, to the Labeling and Mapping team after deciding as a team to adopt the language.  This involved exploring how the language & toolchain could be used in conjunction with React, the library used by a majority of the frontend applications developed by the team today.  While the usage of React + TypeScript, is not unheard of, it is a less popular combination of technologies in the frontend development world.  However Argo/LME is unique in the tools it develops in that we deliver several tools with common core components, making strongly typed contracts and entities highly desirable. The Traffic Light Selector was the first application that demonstrated the usage of React with TypeScript and the benefits of a statically typed language for frontend development (including the reduction of runtime errors & catching type mismatches during development time).  The language and its usage has been well received amongst the team and has become the standard language for new frontend applications. Since its initial adoption, the team has also been slowly migrating the existing JavaScript to TypeScript to ensure type safety throughout our codebase; as of this writing, approximately 70% of the frontend related code in the LME repository consists of TypeScript.  

Introduction & sustained usage of a language involves more than creating a project that utilizes it.  In order to foster adoption of the TypeScript language, ensure consistency of its usage, and minimize developer adoption frustrations, I developed the following:
- TypeScript Style Guide - A Google Doc containing TypeScript specific style guidelines.  This guide is a superset of the organization's JavaScript style guide, meant to augment the pre-existing JS guide for TS specific scenarios.
- Argo_Web_TSLint - An NPM module that encapsulates the organization's JS/TS style guidelines.  This package is deployed to Artifactory, so that any team (e.g. the Triage team) can use our organization's linting rules and receive updates transparently via NPM package updates.  By default, any application spun up using the Argo Web Generator uses this module.  
- Initial TypeScript compiler option configurations - the strictness of type checking in the TS compiler is configurable by design, so that organizations beginning to adopt TypeScript can initially use looser type checks. As the types within a code base become more solid, one can begin to 'tighten the reins' so to speak.  I designed the initial TS compiler configurations to strike a balance between strict checking and promoting developer productivity while working in a new language. Now that the team has gotten its bearings, we've begun to use 'stricter' type checking for new projects and tightening the options on pre-existing applications.

Within this feedback cycle, I’ve continued to serve as an interviewer for a variety of technical roles, with a focus on providing detailed feedback in assessing candidates.

*Communication*

Within the organization, the creation of frontend applications spans multiple offices.  Additionally, the frontend development world is constantly evolving, where new frameworks & libraries are emerging and pre-existing ones are iterated upon at a rapid pace.  In order to create a community of individuals within the organization to share frontend related news, thoughts and questions, I created the #frontend-web-tech Slack channel Within this channel, we discuss changes.

The LME team often has multiple ongoing efforts that result in engineers developing design documentation to describe the shape of a new system that will be developed.  Within this review cycle, I’ve provided feedback/my perspective for multiple efforts, including the LME Repository Split, Off-Vehicle Standards, the Operator Management QA Framework, & LME Build and Deployment to augment the work of my colleagues.

*Team Work*

In December, myself and Matt Gilson worked heavily with the Triage team to ramp them up on our Java backend/React frontend best practices, in order to aid in their turnaround of their initial MVP to the triage solution that is in place today.  This included presenting the ‘LME Stack’ and the reasons we chose certain technologies, learning the MVP implementation of the application, and performing reviews of the revamped version of the application

Recently, I've helped 2 colleagues become readers in TypeScript & JavaScript by providing reader proposal feedback to them prior to presenting their formal proposal to the readers group.  These two individuals were accepted into the readers group, increasing the number of TS/JS readers from three to five.  I’ve also been working with a third TS/JS candidate to do the same to increase the readership pool (they’re received their initial feedback, and are working towards acting on the feedback they received).

*Leadership*

In the last few months, I have taken on a 'co-lead' position in running the Java/Web Meetup.  In Seth's absence I often lead these meetings, setting the agenda and reaching out to members of the Argo community to present at them. I've also spoken myself at these meetings regarding items I'm working on (AWG, Argo Lint Module) to demonstrate their usage and solicit feedback.

Early in this review cycle, I became a reader for JavaScript, TypeScript & Java. Since then,I've read LME as well as other teams (primarily when the Triage team was working out of the AV repo).  Since then, I've reviewed close to 800 PRs.  When reviewing a PR, I focus on facilitating an open dialogue between myself and the PR author in order to adhere to organizational guidelines and best practices for the technology being reviewed.

I recently joined the coding standards committee as a TypeScript/JavaScript representative, in order to provide a voice with respect to frontend development in the organization and to formally update the initial style guide for TypeScript/JavaScript.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Since the fall, Ryan has been instrumental to the organization by spearheading the adoption of Typescript into the web-stack that is used by Argo.  Typescript will positively impact developers by improving the speed at which code can be written, as well as providing the ability to catch several errors at compile time (opposed to run-time) and provide more stringent stylistic requirements that lead to more declarative code.

He has done this through a variety of ways:

* Ryan introduced typescript in applications during his development of the Traffic Light selector.  This application was the first instance of Typescript in our tools.

* Ryan then introduced Typescript into our pre-existing packages.  Typescript has a bit of an initial spin-up cost and Ryan took the initiative to handle this in several packages in order to make sure developers were able to quickly begin using Typescript when adding additional code into the codebase.  Since this point, Typescript has quickly become the primary front-end language that the LME team uses.  Adding the TS Compiler to all of our applications was a substantial contribution to the team.

* Ryan additionally developed the style guide for typescript, setting standards for the new language within the organization. In addition to this, he built out the TS Lint configuration for the organization, allowing us to programmatically enforce style the style guide.

* Due to the large amount of initial configuration that typescript requires, Ryan was able to correctly identify that the spin-up cost of a new application as a pain point that developers would encounter.  He again took the initiative to identify a solution, a yeoman generator that automatically creates and configures an application.  This generator is currently available and is called the Argo Web Generator.

Continuing his work to help improve the organization as a whole, Ryan also achieved readership in Javascript, Typescript, and Java.  He has been the primary reader on Mapping-related PRs as well as having a substantial impact for other front-end teams as well.

He additionally adopted ownership of the bi-weekly Web-technology working group in order to initiate discussion amongst teams on how the organization as a whole should progress in developing our web-technology stack.

Ryan also worked on the Operator Management module to add authentication to the current LME Suite of applications.  For obvious reasons, authentication is a key part of our applications, and Ryan put time in to make sure there was a platform in place for our applications.

Ryan was also heavily involved in the design of all LME suite applications.  Since December, we have introduced 4-5 new applications, all of which Ryan has assisted in, from design time, to review.

Ryan has also led the team by attending TSConf and helping to align our organizational standards with official standards suggested by the people responsible for the language we're working in.

With respect to his current role, it is clear that Ryan is meeting all of the expectations of the next level and is providing significant value to the team.",,,Brad Krupa,bkrupa@argo.ai,Ryan Waskiewicz,rwaskiewicz@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Ryan is a hero for introducing TypeScript into the LME ecosystem.  Even though I had zero prior experience with or knowledge of TypeScript, I was able to quickly see the value it added: discouraging ad-hoc creation of custom, one-off objects and replacing them with proper object-oriented design patterns.  I was more than happy to invest the time to learning and ramping up on TypeScript and adopting it 100% for the Object Point Cloud Labeler.  It has already paid dividends many times over ensuring high-quality code in OPCL.  I have no doubt it will do the same for any other project that can break free from legacy JavaScript and adopt TypeScript in its entirety.  There was a brief period of time when I had to dive back into JavaScript to rip out a hack in the Track Labeler implemented as a workaround to bad Lumberyard data.  It was one of the most painful and jarring programming tasks I've ever experienced, falling from the Heaven of proper static types on everything to a Hell of dynamically created ad-hoc objects that not even IntelliJ IDEA could make any sense of.  Even MyPy doesn't come close to the strength of TypeScript's type system.

TSLint is an important piece of the puzzle, making sure questionable JavaScript code is not simply replaced by questionable TypeScript code.  Ryan's approach to implementing Argo_Web_TSLint successfully created a single source of truth for TSLint configuration across the entire company.  It made it easy for any project to adopt it, even those outside of LME.  My understanding is that the Triage team in Mountain View already does.  The same can be said of the Argo Web Generator, although I haven't had the opportunity to use it for any of my projects yet.

Finally, I relied heavily on Ryan for reader reviews of my TypeScript code for OPCL and the Traffic Signal Localizer.  Even after I became a reader myself, I continued adding him as a reviewer to all of my TypeScript pull requests and waited for his review before merging because they're that valuable.  I've learned a number of neat TypeScript tricks from Ryan through his code reviews, such as constructor parameter properties.  Other than that, my code is generally perfect but somehow Ryan often finds ways to make it even more perfect.  Unit tests tend to be a factor there.

Overall, these accomplishments well exceed the level expected for Eng I, so it's an easy, solid 4/5 rating from me.",,,William Lai,wlai@argo.ai,Ryan Waskiewicz,rwaskiewicz@argo.ai,Software,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Since I have started working at Argo in January, Ryan has helped to train me and has assisted with on-boarding me to the Map Tools team. This has included teaching me the testing software Jest and helping me work through issue with this along the way.

Ryan has been a major contributing factor to converting out code base over to TypeScript. He helped to introduce the technology and has converted over several files. With this new langue it helps ensure code quality and ensures consistency of usage.

Also since I have been here, Ryan has developed an application called the Web App Generator which has allowed our team to quickly spin up new applications. This has helped me specifically get two new applications up and running significantly faster and enabled development to start sooner. 

One of the other projects that Ryan has worked on is creating in an Authentication module. This allows us to decouple it from directly being in our applications and allows us to be able to have one authentication that can be used across multiple applications. This will help with logging and being able to track where and when edits were made.

Ryan was also initially the only reader on the Map Tools team. All of the Map Tools PR went through him. With this, he was able to balance work along with ensuring code quality.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"This cycle, Ryan has been tremendous in progressing our technology stack forward to a more maintainable state.  One area that Ryan can improve upon is maintaining compatibility with some of the upgrades.  For example, the new generator that was created is unable, at this time, to integrate successfully with much of our current code.  This is because the current infrastructure relies on javascript and doesn't generate typings for Typescript, but it does provide a substantial hump when new applications are created and has led to a substantial amount of duplicated code.  Ryan has been responsible for tracking most of the code that has been duplicated, but this has been a pain point for developers making use of the AWG.",,,Brad Krupa,bkrupa@argo.ai,Ryan Waskiewicz,rwaskiewicz@argo.ai,Software,

This was an awesome addition as some of the projects did not have them initially. This helped get coverage on several more areas of code and helped to increase our overall percentage of code coverage.

One area that we could use help improving on is adding additional tests to these projects. Currently just basic coverage is applied, but adding in additional tests and different types of test would help in adding coverage. This would also help in adding testing references as to other ways to write tests. Specifically this would be useful with the new Web App Generator as we are still trying to figure out the best way to write test for the new applications that don't include LME Common.",,,Matt Mahan,mmahan@argo.ai,Ryan Waskiewicz,rwaskiewicz@argo.ai,Software,

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"An area of growth I would like to continue to make is communication with my team lead regarding the resolution of 'technical debt' we've incurred.  For example, most MAPTOOLS applications use React 15.X, a slightly older version of the library (16.3.1 is currently out).  The Facebook team (that maintains the React library) is very generous with its migration plans between major versions, as they have to do those very migrations themselves (Facebook is written using React).  Given the generosity this window, I would hate to see it squandered due to my lack of communication and planning (failure to properly plan could lead to more painful upgrades in the future).

One of the items I worked on this cycle is the decoupling of our LME authentication module from Operator Management.  Currently, it is dependent on any library wishing to use it to use Redux, a state management library.  Adding redux to a relatively small application isn't always necessary.  Given the chance, I would love the opportunity to refactor out Redux and use the newer context API provided by React for better flexibility of our authentication library.

I often see requests for Python readers in the 'ask a reader' channel.  Moving forward I'd like to be able to contribute within Python codebases and eventually work up to readership in this language.",,,Ryan Waskiewicz,rwaskiewicz@argo.ai,Ryan Waskiewicz,rwaskiewicz@argo.ai,Software,

Strict property initialization is an example that comes to mind, a new feature of TypeScript 2.7 that prevents a nasty pitfall that we're vulnerable to today where properties that are typed as non-null can actually be null or undefined with no compile-time error.

Other than that, I'm under the impression that Ryan spends a large majority of his time reviewing PRs not just from LME but also outside of LME.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Sam developed the AL1 lidar data processing algorithms, which I am implementing the back-end of it on an FPGA.  As a team we have implemented the DSP pipeline on an FPGA by January and focused our effort on optimization since then. This would not have been possible without Sam.

Over the last 6 months, Sam has been managing all the tasks relating to lidar DSP.  Sam has demonstrated the attributes of a rising star by applying his extensive knowledge base in data processing and analytical skills in our day-to-day tasks. 

Sam is a key contributor in designing the new lidar Git repository structure and DSP software architecture. Sam has high standard and produces polished results. He encouraged the team to slow down and pay great attention to details. This lead to more errors to be caught early on less fixes down the road. I have personally learned from Sam to be more efficient by slowing down and making the right decision the first time around.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"DSP:

I lead the DSP team to develop raw data signal processing algorithms for the AL1 lidar system.  In this role, I developed algorithms and high-level software architecture, advised on implementation strategies and optimization methods, and directly managed two reports (Gennaro Salzano and Esther Wei -- although the org chart does not reflect this).  As a team, over the last six months, we have nearly completed the full AL1 signal processing pipeline and are focusing efforts on optimization and calibration.  I have gained significant experience in managing and planning tasks, but still need _a lot_ of work in this area.


Recruiting:

I was the hiring manager for three job positions, statistical dsp engineer, lidar test engineer, and lidar simulation engineer, and contributed to recruiting of several other positions.  I completed 27 tech screen interviews, conducted 14 onsite interviews, and successfully hired two candidates into the lidar systems team.  The time investment for recruiting tasks is enormous, and involves resume review, syncing with recruiters, conducting tech screens, creating role docs, and conducting interviews.  I have grown tremendously in this area and feel much more confident and competent in my recruiting skills. 


Architecture:

I am a high-level adviser in gmpad lidar systems development, and contributed to a large number of system architecture discussions, decisions, and trade-off studies with the lidar hardware development sub-teams and av systems team.  I also created a draft of the Gmapd Lidar Handbook as a consolidated resource to educate colleagues about physics, data acquisition, signal processing algorithms, system architecture, simulation, and more.  I have received feedback from both new recruits, and others within the greater scope of Argo, that this handbook has been an invaluable resource to learn about geiger mode lidar.


Software:

The legacy PLI codebase contained nearly 100,000 lines of code in C++ and matlab for infrastructure, device interfaces, data processing, and visualization and was developed over the course of four years with more than 10,000 hours of cumulative development time.  However, the level of technical debt was very large due to the nature of rapid prototyping and continuous learning and familiarization with software engineering practices -- in addition to the fact that I was a singularly responsible for this effort without any prior experience or aid from professional software developers.  I have been continuously porting and refactoring the most valuable sections of legacy code into the Argo codebase, but this task has been particularly challenging with respect to time investment due to the large scope of work, strong dependencies between modules, necessary extensive refactoring and simplification of public user interfaces, need to create unit tests (which previously did not exist), extra care that needs to be taken when uploading interface code to a shared repository, and need to learn new software tools as I adapt to Linux OS and Python.
 

Other Areas of Improvement:

I have grown _significantly_ in my ability to multitask, which is essential in the Argo work culture where slack messages, meetings, and miscellaneous recruiting, planning, and documentation tasks are pervasive in the face of complex technical engineering challenges that require continuous, unbroken focus to make efficient progress.",,,Sam Wilton,swilton@argo.ai,Sam Wilton,swilton@argo.ai,Hardware,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"I've worked very closely with Sam since the acquisition.  Pretty much on a daily basis I'm amazed at the breath of knowledge he has obtained over such a short period of time.  Sam is the go to guy when it comes to LiDAR system design.  I have learned so much about LiDAR over the past 6 months from our long...sometime very long talks that I actually feel like I understand it quite well now.  Sam's time as a TA in college really shines in this area.  He really is a great teacher and can break things down to a very basic level that allows others to catch on to the nuances of the LiDAR system and Geiger mode data at a very rapid rate.  This quality is going to very valuable as he takes on more direct reports.  

Sam has been leading the DSP implementation and even though he doesn't work on the FPGA he has really been leading the charge and helping Esther and myself implement it there as well.  The speed at which he picks up on trade offs we need to make in the FPGA versus what he had to do on the GPU is outstanding.  Sam has been instrumental in getting this design as far along as it is, and has really worked hard on becoming a better leader compared to just the standalone engineer that he was while working at PLI.  Sam is very likely going to be taking on a larger leadership role as this project progresses and the growth he has shown as a leader over the past 6 months has been phenomenal.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Sam leads the LiDAR architecture and DSP team.
Sam has been the key to GmAPD signal processing, he singularly pioneered this work during the previous 3 years with PLI.  His efforts enabled the movement of PLI up the food chain, from GmAPD camera instrumentation supplier to LiDAR systems supplier.  This transition opened new markets to PLI and enabled the possibility that we could be acquired by a cutting-edge autonomous driving company.  Sam has always been, (and continues to be), a self-starter and an outstanding individual contributor, working independently, and most recently directing a team of software/firmware engineers.

Since the Argo transition, one of Sam’s major tasks has been to drive and support the porting of algorithmic processing functions (GPU/CPU based) to an FPGA based implementation.  This work has involved tight integration with Gennaro and Esther, teaching them the details of his processing, understanding the constraints of the FPGA implementation, tweaking the process functions and methods, and evaluating the results of model data.

Sam has been one of the initial adopters of the Agile development schema and has successfully set up the tasks of DSP development and porting into Jira, and conducts weekly meetings to open and close tasks and sprints.  Sam has been very effective in the task management of Gennaro and Esther through this period.

Sam has also lead efforts to standardize and improve the code architecture, testing and review processes.  This leads to better understandability, maintainability, modularity and code reuse.  Test coverage is also greatly improved leading to lower probability of undiscovered bugs.

Sam has increased the size of his group with the hire of two people for statistical process engineering and system/sub-system test engineering.  This involved numerous recruiting cycles (resume review, tech screens, interviews) to finally identify and hire the best resources.  Great strides have been made in Sam’s ability to evaluate candidates’ fit to the required skills.
With the complexities and criticality of Sam’s charter, I would expect Sam’s group to continue to grow in the coming months.  This will probably mean more and more management and administration, which will be a shift for Sam, the majority of his time has historically been highly technical and hands on.  (Sam has a history of being a truly amazing individual contributor).  So far, Sam has been making the transition to a more managerial role quite well.

Sam is proactive in driving architectural discussions and decisions.  This is typically from a data-centric point of view, (it is ALL about the data after all…).  Sam has the deepest understanding (and best model) for analyzing the interplay of LiDAR performance parameters vs. sub-assembly and architectural trades.

One of Sam's early tasks after the acquisition was as a sort of emissary sent from Argo Lidar into the perception software world to work towards integration, cross-pollination of ideas and thoughts, and to communicate the subtleties in GM data and ways in which it departs from the familiar Velodyne sensor.  Though a work in progress, he created a comprehensive document meant to explain and elucidate the principles of operation of GM lidar, define and describe key components, and communicate design decisions and available design space.  This document has been read many dozens of times, I refer to it, and point others eager to understand Argo Lidar to it.  He is quick to share knowledge and great at communicating subtlety. 

Sam's done a good job of describing his work, but I would emphasize that he has made profound contributions across the entire system, including to modeling and simulation, DSP, testing, system design and development, recruiting, documentation, decision making, and in integrating the New Jersey team with the rest of Argo.  The totality of his work, and his contributions since joining Argo, significantly surpass expectations of level 5.  There is no one who understands the broader Argo Lidar system more thoroughly than Sam.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"Recruiting:

I improved significantly in my recruiting skills, but still need to work on a few areas

* I need to improve my ability to filter resumes prior to tech screens, and filter candidates prior to onsite interviews to prevent wasted time from rejecting candidates too far into the interview process.

* I need to improve my ability to screen candidates' software development proficiency.


Productivity: 

In the past, I got the bulk of my technical work done between 6 pm and 2 am, after core office hours to prevent distraction from coworkers, meetings, emails, and other miscellaneous tasks.  Due to severe deleterious effects on my health and personal relationships from spending so much time in the office for so many years, I am no longer able to perform core technical work during my most productive hours.  As a result of this time deficit, in addition to increased time demands during core work hours due to meetings, planning, and recruiting tasks, it has become increasingly difficult, if not impossible to make progress at the same velocity that I was accustomed to in the past.  I need to somehow improve my working efficiency with less available time.  

* I need to improve my work efficiency during core hours and better balance technical work with ancillary responsibilities.

* I need to ignore my perfectionist mindset with regard to architectural decisions, as it causes significant decision paralysis.  The majority of this decision paralysis stems from the fact that I know, from experience, of so many ways that things can go wrong.  The more work experience I gain, the more careful that I am with each step forward, and therefore the slower my rate of progress. -- if it works, it's probably okay.


Management:

My natural state of work is singular, deep focus for extended periods of time without distraction, for which I am free to context switch between disparate parts of the system.  I am accustomed to seeing the vision in my mind, and wandering to the solution in a dynamic fashion over the course of months until the total vision is realized.  However, this working style does not translate well into leading a team, which requires persistent communication, synchronization, planning, and documentation with concrete decision making about architectural interfaces early on in the planning stages.  I need to grow and improve _significantly_ in the area of team management and task planning, and design documentation.

I've never worked in an engineering team for which my technical work tasks were managed, so I have no previous history or guidance to draw on to determine how to perform the job of a technical manager most effectively.  This makes the transition from worker to manager very challenging because I have no experience from the receiving side.  In the past, I was able to transition successfully from student to teacher (as a TA and tutor) because I had 20 years of prior experience as a student, under the guidance of teachers whom I could source the best qualities and most effective communication methods based on my previous experiences on the receiving side.  I am a natural born educator, technical communicator, and a leader in the scope of directing overall vision, but I am not a natural born task manager.  

* I need to improve my ability to plan and execute sprints in JIRA for which the majority of the user stories are complete at the end of the sprint, and tasks are properly reviewed and verified.

* I need to improve my ability to develop well documented task plans and design docs to crystallize architectural requirements and communicate project expectations within the team.

* I need to improve my ability to reliably communicate with team members about task requirements and expectations. 

* I need to prepare status reports on time, and (maybe) spend more effort toward planning and documentation for team presentation materials. 


Software Development:

I am fully self taught in software development, and have historically been responsible for all architectural, design, and implementation decisions in the projects that I have worked on.  I am struggling to adapt my former working style to a team based environment, and also struggling with the decision paralysis that arises from the real world experience of accruing technical debt and understanding the pain associated with failed architecture and design decisions that could have been solved up front.

* I need to improve my ability to make _fast_ and _committed_ decisions regarding the naming conventions and organization of folders, files, classes, functions, and variables.

* I need to improve my ability to make _fast_ and _committed_ decisions regarding software architecture, data structures, function signatures, and module responsibilities.

* I need to improve my ability to effectively utilize source version control and commit small, discrete changes to the code base rather than overextended development work which spans multiple files and projects.

* I need to improve my ability to create and deploy automated unit tests 

* I need to improve my ability to work with Argo software development tools and adapt from my former set of tools.

* I need to improve my Python programming proficiency

Sam will have to find the right balance between individual contribution and team direction, this is a bit of a moving target, but I think Sam should be able to modulate the balance as needed.

Sam has always been his own toughest critic, in many cases being too hard on himself.  This is part of Sam’s personality and drive, he has a genuine interest in creating designs that are as close to perfect as possible, and feels a bit uneasy with “less well thought out” solutions.

6. Worked with motion planning team to show turn signal on Visualization Task (https://github.com/argoai/av/pull/3619)

7. Provided way to save annotations locally so that test engineers need not wait until log ingestion to report problems to engineering teams (https://github.com/argoai/av/pull/3784)

8. Proposed reorganizing visualization plugin to use scene graph like architecture to improve graphics rendering performance

**While we were on Code Red, took initiative to work on:**

1. Removing exception handling where it is not necessary (https://github.com/argoai/av/pull/1798)

2. Reorganized code to remove some of duplicate initialization to improved overall performance of Visualization Task. (https://github.com/argoai/av/pull/1995)

On developing plugin for other engineering teams, I worked on debug log plugin that shows debug log with colors and provides filtering by log level and task name. (https://argoai.atlassian.net/browse/VIZ-306)

In all my work, I developed software with care, took time to understand the requirement and designed with eye on performance and maintainability over long term.

Scott is the only engineer in his group located in NJ and has been playing an important role in some of the major design areas when it comes to the overall system architecture.  The major design decision that has been made in the past 6 months has been related to studies done by his group and from what I can tell he has been vital in that process.  Scott did not get leveled into Argo properly at the acquisition and has been operating at a much higher level than an engineer 1.  Scott is also very knowledgeable about the tools and is a go to person in our office when it comes to Solidworks issues and 3D modeling in general.  ,,,Gennaro Salzano,gsalzano@argo.ai,Scott Roszko,sroszko@argo.ai,Hardware,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Scott is a mechanical design engineer in the ME group.
Scott has taken on the rotary assembly design and procurement task through close collaboration of other members in the group, Chris T. and Bilge K-Y., et al.  This also has involved frequent technical meetings with all downstream stakeholders, (Tx, Rx, Electronics, Thermal, DSP, Optical, etc.), to understand their critical needs and constraints.  Scott has become the clearinghouse for questions regarding, and negotiation of, rotary assembly details.

Scott is the main point of contact for discussions/negotiations with Moog for the 1st prototype rotary assembly.  This initial effort has been driven by deep dives into our functional requirements and the capabilities of today’s rotary technologies.  In the case of Moog, the desire was to get an assembly quickly, with enough functionality to be useful for characterization and proof of several sub-assemblies on a rotating platform.  Scott (and team) were able to arrive at a prototype specification and execute a purchase order for delivery scheduled at the end of May.
He is also working on developing 2nd sources and alternative technologies for further development options of the rotary assembly.

Scott is well liked, easily approachable and supports open and honest communications.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"With the acquisition of PLI I was assigned to an L3 position; however, during the past 6 months I have been consistently performing at L4+. Below are examples of my accomplishments and contributions to the Argo LiDAR team.

Notable Contributions and Organizational Impact:

After the Argo acquisition of PLI I designed opto-mechanical concepts R1, axial air channel and O1, rotating prism for the LiDAR rotating platform architecture taking into consideration thermal, optical layout, and transmit/receive components. To do so, I collaborated closely, not only with my team, but with the other LiDAR teams for power, data, and thermal design inputs. I engaged in the vetting process for the R1 and O1 concepts and others by contributing to a weighted decision matrix and peer design reviews to determine which designs should progress to the next phase based on thermal, power, and risk estimates.

I recognized an information disconnect in the power budget details that were being shared throughout the LiDAR system component design process. To close this gap, I drove the efforts to compile total power estimates for LiDAR system components by creating an organized spreadsheet tool and assigned tasks/information requests to key players. This process brought to light an additional 15% power requirement that was going unnoticed at the time.

Facilitate team understanding of the critical optical variables, including passive/active alignment and tolerancing, needed to accurately incorporate into the mechanical design. I supply updated models to allow rapid concept designs to be pushed forward and engage in standup design meetings.

Following the Argo acquisition of PLI, I became the point of contact for Moog, the vendor for the LiDAR rotating platform brassboard and prototype. Also point of contact for Renishaw and Spinner among others. In addition, I consistently engage in market surveys of potential vendors for the LiDAR system components such as power transfer, data transfer, motors, and encoders. This often includes pulling peers from interdisciplinary groups to get a deeper understanding of a vendor’s abilities and how closely they match our needs.

My initial workload following the acquisition involved multi-tasking between the  opto-mechanical design and simultaneously aiding in the phase out of the fiber coupled APD legacy projects from PLI. I have seamlessly moved into the Argo mode of operation since the acquisition. Often times bringing peers (L4-L6) up to speed with the open network protocols, communication tools (e.g. Slack), and technical software such as Solidworks, PDM, Zemax, etc. In addition to internal personnel impacts, I have successfully been selected as an interviewer for both optical and opto-mechanical open positions at Argo. I have steadily grown my knowledge and provided my honest and unbiased feedback in reviews and debriefing.

I have become a go-to person and central source of information in the NJ office for technical discussions about the physical/mechanical aspects of the LiDAR system (thermal, power, optics, layout, etc.). By effectively bridging the opto-mechanical team with the other NJ LiDAR groups, I have achieved greater cross-functional information flow that has led to increased understanding of project status and potential hurdles. To reduce information gaps, I actively encourage open communication between groups to share design updates, spec changes, power needs, decision outcomes, etc. in real time.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"I have seen significant growth in Scott, both leading up to, and through the Argo transition.  He has become energized with the opportunity and prospects of the new company and has engaged on a much wider scale.  Scott has adapted well to the new environment and workflow and is effective in use of Google suite and productivity tools.

I would advise Scott to become more self-assured and become a stronger technical voice in internal and external meetings.

With the professional and personal growth from his expanded role, as well as the experience understanding he is gaining in internal and external interactions, Scott’s performance and task ownership has been more consistent with an Engineering Level II role.

I'd say he more than anyone had to get accustomed to the zoom room/slack message form of daily design communication and he's done quite well so far.  I think being in those types of meetings makes it even more difficult to get your point across than when sitting in a room in person, so I think getting better at speaking his mind and stating his opinions in this environment are critical to his growth.  ",,,Gennaro Salzano,gsalzano@argo.ai,Scott Roszko,sroszko@argo.ai,Hardware,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"One area where I can continue to grow and improve is asserting my opinions and ideas in a meeting setting.  While I do speak up and without hesitation in more intimate group settings, at times during larger meetings, I delay expressing ideas that may not be fully mature end up missing the opportunity.  With practice, I am developing a willingness to express opinions and partial ideas as jumping off points for the group to work through together rather than waiting for a fully formed idea that I’ve worked through myself.

In recent months, one of our vendors, Moog, has become increasingly difficult to work with by missing meetings, schedule slip, and not returning phone calls. This behavior is not typical of vendors I’ve dealt with in the past, and I’m finding it challenging to know when and how hard to push a vendor to be more engaged or when to move on to another vendor. I am working to improve my vendor management skills through the advice and example of more experienced managers.

Become more proficient using Google drive and Jira for task management and tracking. This will help me become more organized, task appropriate parties, and track my own progress more effectively.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"**Performance Analysis(PA)/Triage:**

I initially was a part of the Performance Analysis team, when I joined Argo 3rd week of Nov 2017.
Here are my contributions/responsibilites:

Triage Data Pipeline (ETL):
- Built parts of the Triage ETL, which is the data source for the Triage applications
- I currently own the responsiblity to ensure the Triage data pipeline is working fine (which involves fixing bugs & making minor enhancements)
- Worked with Zhi on making some schema changes for the Triage DB. I mostly focused on the Road events part of it. 
- Partnered with the metrics team to integrate the Triage ETL with the Luigi workflows (deployed on Datacore's spark/hadoop clusters)

Triage Video Generation Pipeline:
- Collaborated with Cindy to build the Triage Video pipeline to generate 30 sec to 1 minute videos for all the annotated Road Events
- Worked on fixing a few issues related graphics - GPU utilization to render smoother videos, usage of Argonaut & other views. This effort 
  was NOT successful, but we unearthed a bunch of issues which helped us to re-scope the Triage Video project & explore other solutions like VNC sessions. 
- Explored parallelization of the video generation process for a better throughput of the Triage Video pipeline. Was able to partially demonstrate the progress. 

Triage Web Application:
I helped the team with couple of things while making the Triage App
- JWT based authentication for the App, including Google API configurations
- Containerization of the App, including some deployment scripts (for us to deploy the App on Mesos cluster/Marathon)


**Off-board/Jobs Platform:**

Most recently, I have been part of the Jobs platform team which is part of the Off-board software Org. Here are my contributions/responsibilities:

Jobs Platform v0.1:
- Built the Resim Framework to help AV team to run their Resim jobs on Jobs platform (including AV scripts/libraries, schema for Resim jobs results store etc)
- Working with the localization team to build their ""Resim runner"" (resim workflow) on JP (demonstrated an initial working solution)
- Working with the tracking team to build their ""Resim runner"" (resim workflow) on JP
- Participating in the Tactical Rotations (on-call) to help unblock the existing JP users (like SIM team) with their issues (and fix the related bugs)

Jobs Platform v1.0:
- Helped the team design the software architecture for the next version of the Jobs platform (to solve scalabilty issues & also be resonably feature rich)
- Helped the team showcase our future capabilities in order to sign more customers in for JP like Maps team, Metrics/PA team & other AV teams

Accomplishments & Strengths ,report,"Simon and I started working together on a new project, Visual Localization. Simon balanced his time between his external appointment at CMU and his appointment at Argo while overseeing this project. He held weekly project meetings, interfaced between upper management (Brett) and the project team on project status, and managed the project scope and weekly deliverables.

Simon oversaw the Visual Localization project strategically, by defining an initial role (how it might help detect faults in alternative localization systems), setting aside time for literature review (before committing to any specific approach), maintaining an interest in evaluating existing software if possible (to avoid lost time in the long run), and developing a plan that plausibly reuses existing work products (from other parts of Argo) and manages or avoids pitfalls known to the field (e.g. lighting change).

Simon is great to work with, as he maintains a positive leadership style and is able to communicate his message while leaving room for other perspectives. He maintains a balanced perspective that does not forget the positive accomplishments or ""business as usual"" developments when discussing deliverables, such as plan development or test results, which makes the effort seem valued. He entertains thoughts about ideas not yet in the plan, such as requests to other teams that will support long-term objectives.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Slawek came into the prediction team after a huge amount of flux.  He immediately struck up a good balance between seeking a broad understanding of how the prediction interface currently works and its role in the motion planning stack and crafting specific feature improvements.  Notably, prior to Slawek predictions were generated after projecting a reference point onto the centerline.  This not only resulted in unrealistic trajectories but also led to the tracked polygon being incorrectly rotated in predictions through time.  He is currently embarking on the first learning being done by the prediction team.  He is developing fast simple processes for predicting accurate kinematics based on buffered tracking histories.  Once this work rolls out, it will significantly improve the AVs ACC behavior.  In short.  Slawek has gotten started fast and has written some crucially important features.

Another dimension of Slawek is his relationship with the rest of the team.  He is affable and supportive.  He is quick to review other's code and incorporate feedback in his own.  He is supportive and is always willing to take time to help me out with my own sticking points.  He is also contributing positively to the academic/research culture here at Argo.  He presented some of his own research at one of the machine learning lunches.",,,Andrew Hartnett,ahartnett@argo.ai,Slawomir Bak,sbak@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"During the review cycle time-frame I joined Argo AI and I got up to speed with the tools and the code base.  I have also fixed several salient issues in the prediction engine. 
One of the issues was related to incorrectly propagated a yaw offset of a polygon, while generating a predicted trajectory. This had an impact on motion planning that uses the yaw and the polygon of the object to avoid potential collisions. The solution required memorizing an initial yaw offset and updating future yaw while the object changes direction of travel (e.g. takes a turn).
Similarly, I also solved another issue - the prediction engine was projecting any potential future trajectory to the centerline and was generating the future states assuming that an object (e.g. vehicle) will follow perfectly the line of the centerline. This was the incorrect assumption. Instead, I introduced a lateral offset that keeps a relative distance to the centerline, while generating future states of the object.  This was a quick fix rather than a perfect solution, but again, this allows motion planning to reliably perform collision avoidance. Currently, together with a team we are working on better predictions taking into account larger context (e.g. proximity to other vehicles, stop signs, etc). 
While working on these issues, I have discovered another one, related to generating redundant trajectories. This was occurring, when an object’s polygon overlapped with several lane segments in the map. To solve this issue, I designed, developed and implemented an algorithm that from a given list of potential lane segments with which the object polygon is overlapping, it removes the lane segments that are in successor relation with respect to already existing lane segments in this list. The proposed solution is simple (linear complexity w.r.t. the number of lane segments in the list) and makes the prediction engine more efficient as it avoids generating redundant trajectories.
Currently, I am working on (1) estimating and (2) predicting kinematics of tracked vehicle. These are very challenging tasks as they have to cope with noise from tracking data (e.g. a position of tracked object). Additionally, while predicting kinematics we must take into account overall context of the scene (e.g. proximity of stop signs). I started with developing standard models (e.g. using kinematic equations with least square solution) but very soon I am planning to introduce data-driven modeling. This task is crucial for predicting possible future outcomes of tracked objects.
At work I constantly collaborate with John, Andrew and Peter. John is super helpful when solving  implementation issues. With Andrew and Peter I keep brain-storming on model choices for kinematics as well as on data-driven solutions. ",,,Slawomir Bak,sbak@argo.ai,Slawomir Bak,sbak@argo.ai,Software,

He has also been getting up to speed quickly on the coding standards used at Argo, as well as the tools used in day to day software development.  Slawek has also been doing a good job looking ahead to the approaches we will need to take in the future as we move towards more data driven solutions, and writing code in a way that lends itself to the future approaches we will take.",,,John Matty,jmatty@argo.ai,Slawomir Bak,sbak@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Slawek joined in the last week in February. Shortly afterward, he was out of town for a few weeks on a trip that had been planned long before he knew he would be joining Argo. As a consequence, Slawek has not yet had much time at Argo (this is not a bad thing, just context from my review). Nonetheless, he has quickly gotten up to speed on how the prediction code works and started making much needed improvements. 

He was very helpful in quickly addressing two critical issues. I discovered the first issue, which was the yaw for the transform from the origin of the prediction to its polygon was wrong. Slawek quickly addressed this problem and put up a PR that required very minimal changes in review despite it being his first PR. He discovered the second issue, which was that the offset to the polygon could also be off because there was a bad assumption that the track’s origin was inside the polygon. Slawek also quickly addressed this problem. I have found it easy to communicate with Slawek during both of these. He is very open to improving his code based on reviews.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"- Sri could do a better job with managing his frustrations. As i've told him in person, he should verbalize frustrations before trying to demonstrate his frustrations. Since we have had this conversation, I haven't noticed any new issues around this. 

- I think Sri could do a better job of providing rough guidance in cases where full fledged models are not necessarily worth the effort. Sri frequently thinks that all requests are for fully detailed highly accurate models, when sometimes the right response is to just do some 10 minute math and give rough guidance.

- Sri could benefit from an increased system understanding. For AVS, he has a strong understanding of the thermals, but does not appear to have a strong understanding of the rest of the system. For big projects, like AVS as a whole, I think he would benefit from digging through the details not immediately related to thermals, that way he could better understand various tradeoffs. I'll caveat this with saying that I'm not sure what his workload is beyond AVS, obviously doing this takes a lot of time, so it is a tradeoff that may not be worth making.

- Sri could also benefit from a stronger skillset in non thermal software tools. I think Sri would hugely benefit in his career from taking a solidworks course. I wouldn't expect a thermal engineer to be designing whole systems in CAD, but if he could develop some of his own rough concepts, it would help him be able to perform more tasks as a standalone engineer. 

- Similarly, I think maybe spending some time in a linux environment and developing a decent understanding of the command line functions would help him be able to be a bit more autonomous in the testing world as most of our testing will require linux.",,,Ryan Davis,rdavis@argo.ai,Srinivasa Damaraju,sdamaraju@argo.ai,Hardware,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self," One of my biggest strengths and accomplishments has been digging deeper into the tech/troubleshooting side of vehicle ops so that I am informed enough to confidently answer technical questions and adequately explain how and why we do certain things.  Without taking the time to dig in and learn, there would be no training at New Stanton without the daily assistance of a test engineer.  Over the past 6 months I have learned how to ingest in various forms, pull new releases and push them to ops laptops, run fault injection, run two laptops at once to monitor copilot progress, diagnose and troubleshoot software and hardware problems, edit configuration files on the car, and assisted in the calibration process.  A good example of why this is important goes back to the early days when we hired our first groups of contractors and were still using a ""cheat sheet"" to copy and paste commands into many different terminals.  It would have been easier to just teach copying and pasting, not having a good understanding of what we were actually running, but instead I gained insight into what the different task managers were doing so that I could explain it to our contractors, and in turn make them more knowledgable about their jobs and limit downtime due to mistakes and misunderstandings.  These cheat sheets also needed changed very often and mostly came without warning, and I was often able to find the tasks that needed to be run and make the changes quickly so that the cars were usable.  I feel that this amount of engagement and hands-on teaching with the earlier groups helped to set the standard of learning for their later peers, contributed to building a culture of being hungry for knowledge and taking pride in ones' accomplishments, and not shying away from the unfamiliar.

I feel that I have done a good job of setting a very high standard for vehicle operators in both my training and my actions.  We experienced a few huge mileage pushes in this timeframe, and I embraced this increased time in the vehicle with newer operators to train, mentor, and build a rapport with them.  Staying excited and optimistic about our group goals while challenging the other leads to ""set the record"" or hit a milestone has helped get buy-in from our group of vehicle operators.  They now take pride in hitting mileage goals and can't wait to put in the extra time necessary to do so, something that is huge for our OKRs as an organization, but also to our culture as Vehicle Operations.  The end of year mileage goal wouldn't have been possible to hit without qualified copilots, and I feel that I did a good job setting them up for success by coordinating them cycling through my car and training while accumulating miles so that we could be efficient and safe as a group.  I feel that I have helped motivate the group by volunteering for the late nights and weekends to set the example that as leads, we are VOs first, and don't hide behind a desk.

Building an intelligent, informed, and confident vehicle operator has always been a main personal goal, and I feel that I helped do this on a larger scale when we had some very large visualization changes land.  I took the initiative to build a release notes presentation that went visually in-depth with screen shots and explanations of new features and went over how to use them so that our operators were prepared to hit the ground running.  I also shared it with the ops group in Dearborn to assist in making us more informed as an organization and get cars on the road quicker.  We would have had a lot of downtime due to the new image being pushed to ops laptops, so this kept the entire VO group engaged and learning instead of doing busy work, and opened the floor for real time Q&A about all of the new features so they could be more successful once in the car.

An area of initial struggle that I have improved has been end of day coordination at the track for both training and testing.  Leading up to the March 29th demo there was sporadic and unpredictably timed testing going on at New Stanton, and I was always willing to help drive cars but didn't initially realize that I should be helping in a larger capacity.  A few days we had VOs that needed to leave earlier and others that could stay, but I wrongly assumed they knew when they should be leaving and who should be staying.  After I saw the problem, I realized that it would be easy for me to solve because I was there in person daily.  I began acting as a liaison between the engineers, test engineers, VOs, and leads in PIT to get extra resources back to PIT as quickly as possible by identifying testing and personnel needs for the day.  This helped to cut back on unnecessary overtime while supporting all necessary operations into the evening, and helped build a great reputation for Vehicle Ops with those engineering groups.",,,Steven Swartz,sswartz@argo.ai,Steven Swartz,sswartz@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Steve has taught me so much in my time here. He is always ready and willing to jump in and share all the knowledge he has and he does it in a way to help me and other understand what the tech is doing. 

Im not 100% sure, but I think Steve has made Fault Injection Training possible up at New Stanton. Without Steve, we wouldn't have so many quality and well trained VO's.

Steve is always available to help out with whatever is needed. Staying late / coming in early for testing. Coming in on a weekend. Steve loves what he does and it shows and is contagious. 

He has the respect of everyone he works with and especially the VO's he trains. He knows how to make them feel respected and gain confidence. 

It is truly a joy to work with Steve and I always get excited when he is down in Pittsburgh instead of at the track because I get to feel that infection nature. ",,,David Hart,dhart@argo.ai,Steven Swartz,sswartz@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Steve has been fantastic when it has come to training and holding our operators to a high standard.  He does this not only through his teachings, but also through leading by example.  He's great at tying in real examples of how what they're doing impacts the operation.  This is important so that the operators are able to effectively understand how their work is impactful and also see the tangible results in the form of a fleet release or Viz GUI (Argonaut).

Early on, I would often see Steve after shift - sitting in a car playing around with the system.  I have seen him do this many times and as it seems - this was part of his way of familiarizing himself with the vehicle and system.  As operators go through training - they're going to need to know specific pieces of information, and other times - they may just have a really good question that came to mind.  Very frequently, Steve is able to field quite a broad variety of incoming questions and provide complete answers.  Without Steve taking the time to learn the system and it's capabilities, this could have resulted in producing some very average operators - if he was also _just_ starting to figure everything out at the same time they were.  There are far reaching positive impacts this has had overall.  If we don't have knowledgeable operators, then that can start to eat into our efficiency/downtime/safety when they aren't sure what they're looking at or how to proceed forward (what's the next step when starting to troubleshoot, what to do when you see one diagnostic message versus another, etc..).

Steve is also a great resource when it comes to troubleshooting, because of how much in-car exposure he has on a daily basis.  There have been more than a few instances that I had reached out to Steve on Slack to be able to further understand an issue or bug, as well as clarify conflicting information I had been seeing or hearing.  He has put together some slides that show the differences between certain behaviors.  Another great visual aid for our operators.  They're able to clearly see the difference between behaviors.  Consequently, they are able to appropriately tag and describe these various situations and instances they encounter while out on the road because the ""grey"" area has been minimized to narrow the scope of what may or may not constitute a juke, jerk, halt, or pce. (Among other things, of course.)

Steve has done a great job providing feedback to our Viz team to help properly configure the layout of Argonaut to be optimal for Operators.  The impact of this has also not gone unnoticed.  He walked our operators through a presentation (well, he's done the presentation **multiple** times.) with different examples of using the various features available in Argonaut.  He explained how each feature important to an operator could and should be used.

Not once, not twice, but many times when training crews have returned back to the Depot from New Stanton - I have (without prompting them to do so) received overwhelming positive comments about Steve and the excellent job he does training.  He's firm, but fair as well.  He is able to strike the balance between achieving what is necessary and expected from an operator, while also keeping them interested, engaged, and in almost all cases - having fun as well!",,,Anuruk Buranathanit,aburanathanit@argo.ai,Steven Swartz,sswartz@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Steve is amazing and I admire his work ethic and ability to push himself to always be learning! I admire his ability to teach, push people yet he is friendly but not friends, that is not easy. 

Some specifics:
1. Steve is a team player, comes in early and stays late. Steve is always someone you can count on and will not let you down when you need help. In the time I have worked here Steve has shown me an amazing work ethic, working late to help the Dev team and complete VTR's, I have never heard him complain and he always has a good attitude. I admire that and see he sets a great example for myself as well as others!

2. Steve works very hard going above and beyond, he takes his job very serious and takes it upon himself to always make sure he learns everything he can so he can answer questions with great detail. Steve has inspired me to push myself to learn more.

3. Steve does an excellent job speaking in front of groups, teaching and explaining things. This is because he takes the time to learn as much as he can so he can translate information in an understandable manor with confidence. For example when he was showing me how he does the Argonaut training he did an amazing job explaining everything with great detail, I appreciate his ability to teach new VO's with great communication skills. 

4. Steve is probably my biggest inspiration as I made my transition to ARGO, Steve has a fun yet serious personality, he is willing to help and is a great team player. I respect his dedication and the time he spends to make himself a better Trainer. Steve has the experience I lack so I look to him as a Mentor and I appreciate that he is always willing to help me.",,,Lisa Fischer,lfischer@argo.ai,Steven Swartz,sswartz@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Steve has been instrumental in training and instructing all of our VOs through our phase 2 of training at the closed course in New Stanton. This has been a huge feat to accomplish mostly by himself at the closed course and being with them during their first day of public road operations which is one of the most critical days to have someone knowledgeable and experienced in the vehicle with them to help talk them through difficult situations they see on the road.

One of the things I hear the VOs commonly say after they leave training is how does Steve know how to do so much. He was always able to fix everything while we were at the track! He has been able to build his knowledge base since he started working here. Not accepting just copying and pasting commands into the computer but really being able to understand what those commands mean so he can speak knowledgeably and confidently about whats happening to the VOs he is training. This sets an expectation level for all the VOs that we want you to be able to have this knowledge and its there for you to learn as long as you want to rise to the top of the VO population.

Steve has been instrumental in creating and shaping the Vehicle ops culture from the beginning. Its impossible to ignore that fact when ever new VO that comes back from training always talks about how great Steve is at his job, how much fun they had at the track, how much they were able to learn, and most importantly how confident they were in drivers seat before hitting the public roads. Steve has played a huge roll in making sure our VOs are safe on the public roads and keeping our at fault incident number at 0.",,,Mike Vernau,mvernau@argo.ai,Steven Swartz,sswartz@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Steve needs to improve with his communication to the rest of the team.  Since he is focused on phase II training at the closed course he isn't in the day to day interactions around the depot as often. He does a lot of his communicating over slack which is good for quick conversations but sending emails with official results of the trainees, how they did, and some quick notes on things to watch out for on public roads would be a good quick reference to any of the leads going to ride in a vehicle with them. That way we would be able to give valuable feedback to them in the vehicle instead of focusing on things that Steve may have already covered during his week of closed course training. 

Steve needs to focus on really building out the training program by creating some more slides, movies, and some technical quizzes for them to do while they are here at the closed course. This will start to become even more vital for the ops team to be extremely confident in all of our VOs who are operating in cities far away from Pittsburgh and our local support network.",,,Mike Vernau,mvernau@argo.ai,Steven Swartz,sswartz@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"As I have said above Steve is amazing, the only thing I can see that he could do better is his communication to the team on his vision. 

I would like if Steve would let me help him, I think Steve lacks the ability to ask for help. I would love to work with him on projects for training as a team and make the best training team available in this industry. I lack the experience that he has so this is also one of my struggles because I want to take on projects but I am worried about stepping on his toes. I believe better communication between Steve and myself could make a big impact on our training program. 

",,,Lisa Fischer,lfischer@argo.ai,Steven Swartz,sswartz@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"If there were to be an area of growth - I'd like to see (and this may exist, but maybe I just haven't been exposed to it just yet) more of the training documentation to ensure as leads, we're consistently on the same page as far as what we're training to, and what we're trying to uphold as well.  We can stay consistent on our end with any changes that may be taking place on the training side.  Consequently, we can brief accordingly.  I'm not sure if there are notes at all on strengths and weaknesses for each training class, but if that does exist already - that might also be a valuable resource for the team when conducting particular VTR's or pairing certain operators together.
",,,Anuruk Buranathanit,aburanathanit@argo.ai,Steven Swartz,sswartz@argo.ai,Vehicle Operations,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"I need to be more organized and inclusive in my communication with my team.  Often times I assume that everyone is on the same page with my plan because little has changed, but I need to do a better job in updating the team on training progress and goals for the week, and calling fewer last minute ""audibles"".  A few times there has been confusion early in the morning with resource allocation and it has been due to a lack of me communicating a concrete game plan out to the entire team.  In other instances there was uncertainty of what VOs could be paired with AV certified operators, and this could have been alleviated by better sharing of information and documentation.

I also need to focus on building more robust documentation around the training process and trainee progress/stages so that this information is more readily available and accessible to anyone that needs it, including leads in other cities as we scale.  With so much of my time spent in the car focusing on instruction, I have prioritized putting in extra effort in-car while letting written documentation and training materials lag behind.  If I put greater focus on building up the training program, then in turn more can be accomplished out of the vehicle and we can scale much better as we add additional resources and cities.

When things go wrong or I'm struggling, I need to be more willing to ask for help.  There was a day while training that I had a broken car and I thought I was constantly one step away from fixing it and getting back to work, but the problems kept piling up and I lost valuable instruction time because I should have escalated the issue sooner instead of letting my curiosity get the best of me and trying to fix the problem myself.  Greater focus on the scope of my knowledge and ability would have helped limit downtime and kept my trainees focused on learning.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Steve as the sole member of the embedded software team has had a tremendous impact during this review cycle. Steve has come up to speed on the embedded software side of the house at argo and really brought software process into their workflow that has considerably improved the quality and consistency of the releases of Pitt Firmware. He worked to implement runtime configuration of both camera trigger rates and GPS module. he worked closely with my release and deployment team to integrate the Pitt Firmware software update system to more in line with the main AV stack. Signed firmware files are now included in artifactory and pulled into our docker images during deployment. Steve wrote a task that runs on the AVS that handles updating the Pitt firmware via this task.

He has written firmware allowing the PITT module to log all the necessary data to show operational success during thermal tests. He was able to quickly adapt to changes needed as we discovered bugs and issues during testing. He is/has been an intricate part in helping set up the PITT module, CMS, and AVS board bring up activities supporting my needs on testing side. Steve has also been a big support in test activity meetings where is experience and expertise has helped shape certain aspects of testing (coming up with firmware specific to test needs).",,,John Grose,jgrose@argo.ai,Steve Ressler,sressler@argo.ai,Hardware,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Over the past six months I have continued firmware development on the PITT module including implementing runtime configuration of the camera trigger rates and the GPS module, allowing for both of these to be performed manually or to be automated. I extended the firmware update system to support firmware signing using public/private key encryption. This increases both the security and reliability of firmware updates. As part of the release process, signed firmware files are now stored in Artifactory and are available to be pulled into docker images for deployment on vehicles. I also created an automatic firmware update task which runs on the vehicle. This system now enables Argo to update PITT module firmware on every vehicle by changing a config file in the codebase. This system will be used on three upcoming modules in Z1 vehicles and will significantly help scaling of firmware updates. As part of this effort I created design documentation to communicate the current security strategy to the systems engineering team.

I supported environmental and RF testing of the Z0 PITT module by contributing to test plan development, carrying out tests using logging software I developed and compiling data for test reports. This software can also be used to perform design validation testing by the tier one manufacturer of the Z1 ITM module.

As part of the Z1 hardware development effort, I produced firmware development plans and a schedule for each of the modules being produced. This development plan, along with a multi-stage development plan for communications between AVS and CMS that Michel and I created, was used by TPMs to develop program timing and to coordinate with the systems teams to assemble the documentation required to communicate between AVS and the AVP. I was responsible for developing and communicating end of line test plans for the CMS hardware in partnership with Veoneer, our manufacturing partner.

I was able to quickly identify an alternate RTOS and get examples up and running after learning that our RTOS vendor would not support the new generation of microcontrollers used in CMS. This RTOS selection will be used across all embedded modules for Z1. Despite this delay, we are still on track to deliver end of line test firmware to our manufacturer without delaying production of the CMS module. I’ve initiated a trade study for RTOS options moving forward into the Z2 build and the team is continuing to engage with vendors and evaluate options. I was able to deliver a firmware image to the ITM module manufacturer ahead of schedule and adapt and extend the PITT module end of line tests to offer more coverage than the Z0 PITT build. This end of line test software records the serial number and results of each module tested, and will be adapted for the remaining module end of line tests.

I have also contributed to portions of the hardware development effort for Z1, particularly on the ITM and CMS modules. I was active in hardware design reviews and debugged hardware failures in the Z0 PITT modules which resulted in lidar power failures, which was corrected for Z1 modules. I also worked to help debug lidar network configuration issues which caused loss of lidar time sync across the Z0 fleet.

I’ve created several HackerRank questions which teammates have been using in embedded software interviews. This consistency in interviewing allows the team to draw more even comparisons across embedded software candidates. I led the effort to have our node locked embedded toolchain licenses moved to a floating server, which will be valuable as we have more engineers joining the team.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Steve has largely taken over the PITT project, and by extension, much of the embedded software engineering effort at Argo. He has consistently written very good code, implemented features, and tracked bugs as reported by consumers of PITT data in a timely and professional fashion, all while maintaining a finger on the pulse of the Argo embedded software recruiting effort, as well as software planning for AUTOSAR requirements for Z2 and beyond.

As the de facto leader of the embedded software development effort at Argo, he has championed multiple initiatives to bring Argo embedded more in-line with standard software practices - automated testing fixtures, binary archiving, standardized feature request and bugfix branch-and-pull design cycles have all been improvements to his department primarily driven by Steve. 

Additionally, this cycle, Steve has started reaching out and interacting with engineers at Tier 1 suppliers, helping to debug and establish testing procedures for new modules designed at Argo and built elsewhere. This is a large step in ensuring that Argo remains a valuable link in the chain between Tier 1s and vehicle integrations.

Overall, Steve has really grown into his role at Argo, and is doing a terrific job keeping up with the enormous wave of work that gets thrown at him on a regular basis.

These include design documentation for the firmware update system, embedded software task planning documents, and documentation for setting up embedded development environments. I think this is a step in the right direction, but as the team grows and more people are working on embedded projects I believe I should try to continue to improve and make sure I use company standards for documentation when appropriate, and encourage other team members to produce design documentation.

Process- When I’m the only person working on a software project it’s easy to fall into bad habits and I need to try to avoid this, especially as more engineers join the team. I will continue to try to align more closely to the process the greater software team uses, specifically by extending the coding standard to embedded software and enforcing proper code review process.

Collaboration- I should do more to collaborate with other teams in Argo. An example of this would be working with infrastructure to incorporate the embedded software repositories in the av codebase. This would enable changes that affect both embedded modules and the vehicle codebase to be performed at the same time, as well as giving other teams better visibility into the embedded code.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"I've effectively had two different roles here so far in my first half year at Argo, first growing the performance analysis capability and now on the STS team.  My strengths that have served me best in both of these roles are the ability to quickly get up to speed in new areas and to work across a wide variety of problems.

I was the first hire (outside of the hiring manager) on performance analysis.  Since I hadn't used SQL or Python prior to starting, I had to get up to speed on both of those quickly and rely on the expertise of other team members in these areas as they came on to get many of the details of the system set up.  During those first few months, I laid much of the groundwork for setting up the performance analysis team including helping to develop the performance analysis OKRs, planning for how the PA team would interact with the Triage and data teams, getting team wiki pages and documents on getting started with our tools set up, getting us up and running on Jira, and laying out our plan for the quarter including sprint planning.  Given the small size of the team, I was also heavily involved in the development and maintenance of many of the dashboards and metrics calculations.  

Although I'm no longer a lead with the creation of the STS team, the focus of the new team is closer to some of the things I've done in the past, so the scope of my contributions have started to increase.  My growing experience with databases and Python from performance analysis has also paid off.  When the STS team started, I created a few set of slides that helped to contribute to the definition of the team's scope.  During the start of scenario creation, I was was also heavily involved in reviewing and setting up the scenario ontology tags and yaml formats for the MVP method of tagging scenarios.  I created the initial version of the database for the STS scenarios (technically a schema within the srr database) and wrote the first scripts to automatically populate the scenario database from the yaml files.  In addition to making scenarios and helping to identify debug multiple map issues for the March 29 demo, one of my biggest contributions to the STS that is starting to bear fruit is my push to automate more scenario generation through scripting.  Given the size of the team and the nature of many of the scenario variations, this should both increase the likelihood of meeting our goals and potentially greatly increase productivity.  There are a few specific areas where this has paid off already.  I developed scripts to convert the majority of the utm maps to city maps with minimal manual adjustments needed.  I have also demonstrated the large scale automated creation of scenarios for two sets of variations requested by motion control with approximately 100 and 500 scenario variations each.  I am currently working on broader automation to produce not only variations but scripts to create permutations of base scenarios that can be applied across different intersection types.  As I've gotten more heavily involved in figuring out how to scale scenario generation, I've also been working closely with the SimEng team to identify new capabilities for the simulation and priorities existing features in the queue.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Tim has been an strong contributor in day-to-day work as well has stepped in as an effective manager in many situations both in the PA team and STS team, spanning group re-org.

- As part of PA team and STS team, played a key role in setting OKRs, priorities week-to-week, tracking progress
- Set up and led some key meetings with other groups to coordinate group interfaces (e.g. with data team, with MP/MC folks to discuss test metrics), with cattard to iron out details on specifics of ko/to detection in logs, with ops folks to help validate early data on mileage
- Create useful automation improvements in scenario generation
- Assist in plans of attack for scenario creation priority
- Good insight and diligence in tracking down issues with either sim run failures or metrics data puzzles
- Taking lead in exercising latest SimEng tooling (e.g. triggers, TL tools), providing useful feedback, coordinating how to get most ""bang for buck"" out of simulation testing technology we have or will have soon",,,David Lenkner,dlenkner@argo.ai,Tim McGee,tmcgee@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"I agree with Tim's review of himself.  He does occasionally get ahead of the game with planning capabilities and what we should work on now to meet the current MVP product.   SimOps will need processes from STS as we go forward, tempering the desire to get things done now vs. creating the process that we will use going forward will really help SimOps launch effectively as a team.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,manager,,,,Chip DiBerardino,cdiberardino@argo.ai,Tim McGee,tmcgee@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Tim has stepped into some pretty challenging tasks where coordinating between teams on cross-functional projects requires some real finesse, where it's hard to build clarity and agreement on what processes should happen between what folks.  Probably some improvement on building alignment on these processes is a place to look.  That's a big challenge given the tight timelines we shoot for, and also the tight group cohesion generally at Argo.  So not sure what the right way to do that it, but it's something to work on.

Other than that, probably more improvement with Python/SQL chops and using github PR involvement to learn those code specifics.  Already much improvement since months ago on that, just continuing the trend.",,,David Lenkner,dlenkner@argo.ai,Tim McGee,tmcgee@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,,,,Derek Hartl,dhartl@argo.ai,Tim McGee,tmcgee@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"There are two areas where I think we have to find the right balance and continuously adjust as a team: balancing short term and long term goals and balancing results oriented culture vs. process oriented culture.  Looking at my own involvement in several projects, there have been a few times, where I've had to adjust my perspective on these to meet the current needs of the organization.

Early in the development of the performance analysis team, my expectations for what we could be doing got a little ahead of what we were capable of doing.  I was starting to looking a little too far ahead at the time at how to do things like automatic event tagging while there was still a lot of easy low hanging fruit like just making histograms of operator tags.  Once I adjusted my perspective on this, we started to get more positive feedback of folks using our dashboards.

The second area is process vs. results oriented development.  I tend to be more results oriented and less process oriented.  This results both from how my own brain works and also having worked on many projects where I've seen excessive process that adds minimal value.  As the STS and SimOps team grows and more of the work is handed off to people who will not all be experienced engineers, I recognize that the level of process required will likely be higher than what has been optimal on my past projects that have remained smaller teams of engineers.

Another area I wanted to address briefly here is related to promotions (there is no section below for it so I'll mention it here).  Comparing technical ladders here vs. where I came from, I think my previous role was closer to a mid to high 6.  Also, I was offered a Level 6 role that I turned down to join Argo.  With the restructuring of the teams, and having to get up to speed in some new areas, I recognize that promotion this cycle is likely low probability, but I'm definitely interested in getting more feedback as to how to get back to the Level 6 so that I can set my expectations accordingly.  Regarding my overall score, I choose 3 since I did have a few areas like Python and SQL that I had a learning curve on when I first started, so I felt like I started slower than I would have hoped.  As some of the areas of automation that I've been pushing start coming to fruition, I expect the realized impact of my work to be larger the coming quarters.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Simulation GUI - I took ownership on designing and implementing the first batch of visualization and editing capabilities to enable SimOps and STS team to effectively create simulation scenarios with static obstacles, movers, vehicle routes and positions. 

Ford BoD video of the simulation tool - I applied area of expertise to improve upon current visualization tool for creating more polish looking demos. Enhancements include perspective view angle, better lighting and color selection, and full screen anti-aliasing.

Simulation framework city map migration - I coordinated with team members and STS team to execute a complex plan on switching UTM based code to city coordinate based code successfully with minimum disruption to customers (MP/MC teams). 

Point and click route selection - I implemented the feature to allow users to select start and goal lanes using point and click, a usability improvement for both vehicle operators and MP/MC developers. This is an example of works I contributed outside of the simulation team.",,,TinTin Yu,tyu@argo.ai,TinTin Yu,tyu@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,manager,,,,Ning Zhang,nzhang@argo.ai,TinTin Yu,tyu@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"TinTin is the sole developer for designing and implementing visualization features for the simulation.  TinTin has developed multiple features in order to quickly define and generate a simulation scenario.  Each tool created is intuitive and easy simple to use.  Each feature to define vehicle starting position, simulated mover paths and behavior, and static obstacles have all required multiple areas of integration and have adapted as the definitions of each have progressed over time.  

TinTin also modified the visualization of the simulation to create a multiple views of the simulation as it transitioned from different perspectives.  The resulting video of the simulation was very impressive.

TinTin also worked on transitioning the simulation from a UTM coordinate frame to city coordinates.  This involved re-defining the configurations needed to specify the simulation in city coordinates as well as adapt the current controls for creating a scenario using the new coordinates.

TinTin continues to deliver on the never ending list of requests for creating controls and visualizations for new simulation features and improving existing controls and visualizations.

TinTin manages a dual role of both visualization team and the sim team.  He primarily supports Sim visualization but also needs to plan and coordinate with the rest of the visualization team.",,,Tom Ackenhausen,tackenhausen@argo.ai,TinTin Yu,tyu@argo.ai,Software,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"I worked closely with TinTin during this cycle. On a high level, I found TinTin to be a highly competent engineer with cross-functional knowledge. I found communication with him easy and straightforward.

I worked directly with TinTIn during the Simulation framework city map migration. He provided valuable insight during the implementation of several modules required for city map migration. His knowledge of computational geometry allowed him to provide me with several tips to significantly improve the capabilities of the modules I was implementing. 

As the SimGUI feature owner, he has always tackled bugs promptly and efficiently. Feature he develop has saved countless hours off developing Scenarios and the Engine itself.

Overall, I find working with TinTin enjoyable and intellectually stimulating.",,,Arjuna Ariyaratne,aariyaratne@argo.ai,TinTin Yu,tyu@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"- SimGUI
TinTin has near complete ownership of the SimGUI. This is the key tool that all simulation users use in order to create, edit, and maintain scenarios. Key users of this GUI are SimOps and STS, however many users in MP, MC, and AI will also make use of this tooling to help accomplish their tasks. This tool needs to be continuously updated as new features are added to Sim.

- Ford BoD video of the simulation tool
TinTin did a remarkable job in polishing the simulation visuals for the Ford BoD video of the simulation tool. These changes resulted in the GUI visualization going from being functional to also looking much more professional - very important when presenting to the Ford BoD.

- Simulation framework city map migration
TinTin was a key member in the simulation framework city map migration working with the SimEng team and STS to execute the complex plan to switch from UTM based maps to City Coordinate maps. This required code modifications to all Sim GUI features which used UTM based map assumptions and needed to land in a coordinated effort with many other efforts.

TinTin has a high level of responsibility in the SimEng team as his work is directly visible to all of the SimEng clients. The SimGUI needs to work with each new feature that is added to the simulation codebase. TinTin does an excellent job, reaching out to the appropriate people when needed (both inside and outside the SimEng team) to ensure what he is designing will provide the proper functionality and be easily usable by SimEng clients.",,,Michael Nayhouse,mnayhouse@argo.ai,TinTin Yu,tyu@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"TinTin is a Software Engineer II working on visualization tools, mainly for simulation. I have had the luck of working with him for several problems, including showing mouse hovered position (https://github.com/argoai/av/pull/3266). Through these collaborations, I have reviewed much of his code and received feedback from him as well. I feel that he is helpful, proactive-thinking, and has solid engineering skills.

For example, for working on the mouse hovering position problem, he spontaneously taught me some background knowledge I didn't possess and reviewed the code for me carefully. With his help, I could understand the difference between different types of coordinates, which was confusing for me at that time.

TinTin often thinks and acts ahead of us. He volunteered in several important experiments. One such example is that he experimented on adding lighting to the vehicle, making it look much polished. This feature is now added to our Q2 plan, and his work will be very useful for this task.

In general, I think he fully meets the expectations of his level and starts to perform at the next level. He should be encouraged to take more responsibilities in the future.",,,Carl Chen,cchen@argo.ai,TinTin Yu,tyu@argo.ai,Software,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Tom has been a good ally for the Vehicle Operations department as we continue to understand our relationship with Ford.  He has been terrific at simplifying process on easy requests (support vehicles and vehicle transportation) and done a good job helping to seek clarity on more complex tasks (building out RASIC for Ford/Argo beachhead launch).  He is a pragmatic thinker and understands the long game of what we are trying to accomplish with Ford.  

He was critical in the Miami terminal search, both being on the ground to comb through the options, but also to help guide Ford’s FCS team through uncharted waters, as they are a relatively new team that is still understanding their place in the field of Autonomous Vehicle development.  Tom has been diplomatic in helping everyone find their voice in this project, while also making sure the work and processes that Argo needs to complete, stays in-house.

Tom has also done a good job of supplying us with the resources needed to plan departmental growth.  Future generation vehicle build plans (which are not always clear), OKR development schedules, vehicle modifications (lightbar, vehicle wraps, etc), have gone about as well as possible considering the stage of growth we are in as a young company. 

Tom has also done a great job both scheduling, deflecting and supporting a seemingly never ending request of Depot Visits from Ford.  It can be a disruptive force if not handled correcting and they have all been scheduled appropriately and usually end in Ford walking away with a sense of relief when they see how organized and professional the operations team treats the work.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"I think we still need to understand the role of the TPM team within vehicle operations.  By nature, most of the Vehicle Operations team is fairly detailed, timeline driven group.  Some of the work that lends itself to TPM management is done organically.  The TPM team has time and again volunteered to assist with the expansive catalog of work we engage in, but understanding where that support could be most valuable has been a bit elusive.  We continue to meet on that topic and the better we each understand the scope of work, the easier we will find those overlapped pathways. 

Tom is probably exposed to information and planning sessions(build dates, changes in vehicle numbers, etc) that have the ability to disrupt vehicle operations.  Any additional information that is mature enough to pass along to help protect against lost effort or misguided growth plans, would be a benefit.  I don’t think there has been an example of poor communication, but just a reminder that the more information we have, the better we can plan and forecast for the future.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Strengths:

Reliable - Tom is very reliable and comes in early to do whatever is needed. Examples of this are setting up for a company event or a Ford visit. Most example being bring your child to work day. All of these things take coordination and working together as a team. He always makes himself available and tries really hard to keep everyone happy. He almost never misses work and takes a very little vacation. Anything I have asked it was completed on the date or ahead of time.  

Adaptable - Tom is very adaptable and can turn himself into whatever is needed facilities wise. Examples of that are at one point he was grabbing all the snacks and stocking everything. When we needed someone to help out with the Zoom installations he took that on. When basic electrical changes are needed he can that. When the depot roof started leaking he stepped in and handled that as well. Really a perfect jack of all trades. He also keeps the building manager here at Crane happy. 

Taking charge - Tom is very good about taking charge and completing tasks on time. So much of internal operations is just making things happen so seamless that others don't even know it is going on. All of this going while Argo continues to scale and changes in the org chart. 

Growth/improvement area - It appears Tom is getting a little more comfortable getting his expenses in and the overall computer work that has been asked of him.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Tom has done an unbelievable job of keeping the depot equipped with the necessary items (snacks, TVs, monitors, etc...) to ensure a quality operation.  At times it's difficult being in a building that is disconnected from the main office.  It would be easy to have the mentality that we are a separate organization.  However, Tom takes the opposite approach and has made it a point to ensure we have everything we need on a daily basis.  Every time he stops over he is quick to seek us out before he leaves to make sure we don't need anything else.  

I also want to note Tom's upbeat/get-it-done personality.  Every time I see him, he always has a smile and usually has something funny to say.  These interactions go a long way in lightening the mood in an often stressful environment.

Tom has made incredible strides in terms of his use of technology.  If you don't come from this industry or aren't used to using tech in general, ticketing software can be a major challenge.  There is a steep learning curve.  It's been great seeing him really tackle an area that once wasn't his strength.  ",,,Brandon Duncan,bduncan@argo.ai,Tom Nagy,tnagy@argo.ai,General & Administrative,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"The accomplishments and projects that I am most excited about are installation of the solar gate at New Stanton facility. I obtained bids from North American Fencing and Allegheny Fence which came in between $12,000-15,000 and Travis and I were able to complete the project for under $1000.  I appreciate the opportunity and look forward to continuing to looking out for the bottom line of the company. Another accomplishment that I feel worth mentioning is becoming the company zoom specialist along with Dom by installing approximately 20 tv's over the last several months . 
I have made personal improvements in my computer skills with the ticket system and slack. I have sought help from Becky and now with Dom, to help when I have a question.  I also adjusted well to the mileage reimbursement program that was new to me. I addressed spending patterns by working with purchasing in order to reduce the time I spend in Concur, specifically for the recurring costs from snow removal and guardian storage to PO for purchasing.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Computer skills/programs - Although this is an area Tom has improved on he still needs to continue to work on this. I think if he could help out here more and it could really beneficial for Amy/the team. In general changes in facilities are very fluid and dates slip so having someone else that can update charts in scheduling or other documents could be beneficial. 

Better hand offs - We really need to work together and make sure we have a better process when moving furniture/assets from one place to another. I know Tom is focused on completing the task but I think it would be greatly beneficial to ask questions and let Tyler know where stuff is going. It is an extra step but an important one to close the loop. 

Thinking scale - This is a challenge for everyone and every team in the org. How do we scale and continue to make things better? I encourage you to work with your manager and other teams on figuring out ways to be more efficient, pro-active and keep down time to next to 0. Communication is also key in scaling an organization.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Tom has been instrumental in assisting Tyler with inventory tracking and asset management. He has helped brainstorm and implement ideas that have been put in place to minimize the chance for missing assets; some of the ways he has done this include: ensuring all networking assets in the server room at Crane, the Depot, and New Stanton are asset tagged and update appropriately in FreshService. Tom has also ensure any new hardware assets that are received in Pittsburgh are asset tagged immediately and added to FreshService--this helps IT tremendously by cutting down on the time we were spending doing this and so it is greatly appreciated. 

Furthermore, Tom makes it a point every Friday to scan our current stock levels to ensure no items are missing or not updated properly during deployment. This ensures we have visibility on all assets. He has done a really great job tracking down assets that have been flagged as questionable.

On top of all of that, Tom comes to work each day in a great mood. He engages in friendly conversation and is always willing to help in any way he can. He ensures that anything we are waiting to be received, is checked in quickly while also making sure anything that needs shipped out, is shipped out asap and to the appropriate location.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"As Logistics Associate II I am responsible for daily processing & monitoring of inbound/outbound shipments.  Inventory monitoring, asset tagging & tracking, satellite office monitoring along with special projects appointed by Tyler Puntureri. Weekly Interaction with vendors following up on shipment discrepancies, and PO status updates.

Collaborating daily/weekly with every team at Argo Ai has allowed me to form strong, productive relationships.  I was nominated & awarded 2 peer spot bonuses, both by facilities. Most recent peer award Acknowledged for filling in during the absence of Tom Nagy.  Taking on additional work load while concurrently fulfilling normal job duties & side projects.  Lastly, the first peer spot bonus was for assisting Tyler Puntureri when a bathroom leak was discovered preventing any possible injury.

Expectations have been met, maintained, and exceeded during my first 6 months as Logistics Associate II with Argo Ai.  When joining the team I knew it was going to be a challenge, that opportunity excited me the most.  I feel I have more to offer, capable of making more of an impact if afforded the opportunity.

First 6 months highlights listed below. 

Accomplishments
-2 peer spot bonus awards  

Shipments Processed & Maintained  
-Inbound Shipments: 2,798 products accounting for 45% of company total
-Outbound Shipments: 295 products accounting for 69%  of company total
-Locations: Crane, 3 Crossings, New Stanton, The Depot

Inventory/Asset Overview
-1,497 tracked assets 42.5% of company total
-Weekly inventory counts working along Tyler as well as i.t dept (Dom/Josh). Follow up analysis is conducted on a weekly scheduled basis with i.t dept (Dom/Josh) ensuring accuracy while constantly investigating missing assets. 

Projects
-Created & helped implement a streamlined fixed asset tagging process, recording all qualifying assets as they are received in real time.
-Analyzed current vendor invoices and identified cost savings opportunity that could reduce shipment costs by approximately ~15%.  Shifting business to our strategic vendor (UPS), would lead to fewer invoices for accounting & reduced cost per shipment.
-Furniture asset tagging for each conference room with Tyler Puntureri
-Identifying assets to be re-purposed that wont be coming to our new Office.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Tom started while I was out of town, so I honestly didn't even know who he was for at least a couple weeks.  Since actually learning who he is he's become a critical part of the company and someone I frequently depend on.  The company as a whole, and my department in particular, relies on being able to send and receive all kinds of things, so to me it seems like a tall order to keep track of and be responsible for it all.

I quite frequently run into scenarios, as I did this past Friday (May 4th), when I found out we needed to set up a computer for a specific purpose and get it shipped down to Miami by Monday morning for critical calibration work.  I had this ready for Tom at around 3:30, maybe a little later, and he hustled to get this measured, weighed, and out the door.  It was delivered Monday morning and the guys in Miami were very appreciative.

The scenario above is very common for us.  He also goes out of his way to pick up the shipments Dell messes up (when they tell us they can't get delivered to us even though the address they have is correct and the same one we use to get everything else we ever have delivered).  I also frequently have to let him know when I've got important items arriving which are needed as quickly as possible and he always gets them checked in and in my hands as quickly as possible.  He's also just a good guy, which makes him easy to work with, as well.",,,Josh Davis,jdavis@argo.ai,Tom Patterson,tpatterson@argo.ai,General & Administrative,

He ensured everything made it back to the office or the depot and was properly stocked.  None of this was an easy feat since Tom doesn't have a pickup truck at his disposal.

He's a great person to work with because of his willingness to help out and really friendly attitude. I would just suggest that during weekly scans we make sure we're scanning and verifying items before he and Tyler run their FreshService reports--this is where the ""buy a new scanner"" comes into play.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"I love that packages are delivered directly to us at Argo, and Tom does a great job of this.  The challenge for Facilities, with as much as we order, is the timing when something might hit our desks (and that we don't always need it on our desks).

Knowing that we might be in the queue with 50 other packages, I don't expect faster delivery, but a same day notification would be great either via slack or email.   This also could save Tom & Tyler some time since Facilities doesn't always need the items we order delivered to our desks.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,report,"Since I've joined Argo, Tom has taken on progressive responsibility and leadership as the tech lead of the Motion Planning team. Tom now drives our OKRs and owns the technical deliverables for our team. I really enjoy working for and with Tom. His knowledge, experience, expertise, and coaching are invaluable to the success of our team. Tom has also been a great advocate for our team, relaying our successes and challenges to Al, Brett, and Pete, and also sharing clear directives and priorities.

Although Tom doesn't have regular code deliverables as part of the sprints that we do as a team, he has delivered on many occasions critical code and bug fixes during times of very high pressure on our team, and has helped focus us on getting through these tough periods. His ability to manage and coordinate many and diverse streams of work is critical to our success.

I recall a specific occasion where Tom led from the front, traveling to the New Stanton test site with a segment of our team and working with us to make sure that our code was well tested on vehicle prior to a high profile demo. I really enjoyed working with him and learning a lot from him about validating the MotionPlanning stack.

Tom has a standing 1:1 with me every other week, which began as once a week. We meet regularly and talk about my goals of taking on more technical ownership and about leadership opportunities. ",,,Jay Sidhu,jsidhu@argo.ai,Tom Petroff,tpetroff@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"I believe that the below information regarding the work I've done, and how I've lead the Motion Planning team provide evidence that I am ready to be promoted from  L5 to L6.

A lot has been happening within the motion planning team.  As the lead for the motion planning team I've had to balance a lot of development efforts, technical debt, planning, etc.
At the beginning of the year the motion planning team (including myself), consisted of 6 people.  Now the team is up to 10.  During this time I've helped the team plan and deliver many features while also managing a large team.  I have helped the team to be effective and efficient.  I have also helped the team to balance autonomy integration issues with planned work.  Often that means taking on the work to address the autonomy integration ticket myself.

As a team lead I've made sure to take the time for 1:1s, in the past scheduled weekly, now bi-weekly as the team has grown.  This way the 1:1 is in place, and we can meet as needed, or cancel if there is no need to talk during that session.  (We did have a laps in 1:1s during March to deal with the time crunch for the big demo).  I've ensured that the members of the team know they can come to me with questions, concerns, suggestions, etc.

Knowledge & Technical Skills (Design, Implementation, and Testing):

Just managing a team of 10 is a full time job -- including 1:1s, sprint planning, quarter planning, long term planning, etc.  But, beyond that I've found time to develop designs for components in the system, review all the other various designs for components, review code (less and less of that now days), and fix bugs in the system.

Design:
Lane changes - worked with MP team and Al to balance and define MVP effort for lane changes.  Provided suggestions and helped the team come up with a vision for lane changes.  Worked with the team in design reviews, and provided feedback as needed.  In the end we delivered a robust MVP solution for lane changes, that can be enhanced going forward without having to be scraped and redone.  Design folder for documents developed by the team:  (Must of design efforts led by Chris) https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DALEDXJ6fJb4DxZjtou48YaXYmENy_M6
Intersections:
I developed the first design for intersections: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GeoNPBR9gToFYzDFCQEFprVQkvEJZfZUj6L5vkrRvFg/edit#heading=h.7flbfqtlomc8
As a team we followed a very iterative approach to developing intersections, starting with true minimal MVP and expanding from there.  Since then the design has been improved, and the intersection component of Motion Planning improved.
Mover Decision Module:
MDM was another main Motion Planning component that was recently designed, providing the ability for the AV to determine whether to pass or queue for an object.  I provided the initial design: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZC9hRukDgJU0OkOOn_9aztJVs31eQ_vESQ4Px3NBgH8/edit#heading=h.7flbfqtlomc8, after that Chris took the reigns on this and further developed and solidified the design: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1R9wWvlBUeLxbRven8bwyhbpRSbmIAsKp
Other small design efforts:
Stopping Trajectory (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RXVNP2Xf1zp6SFLcQGCdVL2GTEBj-8s7)
Lane Positioning (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1N0TQ2CzSl56mkoljLqKqkELUKkraeEtt)

A few other designs I reviewed and helped the team iterate upon: (Efforts led by)
Static Obstacles (Neal/Ramadev)
CorrespondenceLadder (Ramadev)
Trajectory Generator reactor and parallelization (Ed)

Previous review cycle designs and implementation:
This design and development has been ongoing from previous review cycles.
I designed, developed, and tested the profiling framework used within the AV code, this has helped the Motion Planning team quickly evaluate at a high level bottlenecks within the code.
I designed, developed, and tested the first version of the AV UI.
I designed the first version of our traffic signal module.

Org Impact & Communication:
On the planning side I have ensured that our team has a sprint plan each sprint, with tickets, and estimates on the tickets.  I've worked with Al, MC, prediction, sim, mapping, and other teams to ensure that our quarter plans align and that needed features fit together in our timelines.  I hold backlog grooming sessions with our team to break up tickets into small pieces, estimate tickets, etc.  This makes it easy for TPMs to see the current state of the Motion Planning backlog. 
 During planning for the quarter, and each sprint, I work to balance feature development with technical debt, often this is difficult, but I work the best I can to ensure we deliver features when needed, and keep down technical debt as much as possible.  Throughout this effort I've been improving my skills to generate a realistic, but aggressive road map, as well as adapting the roadmap as new things are learned, priorities change, etc.  I think the MP Q2 roadmap is an excellent example of this.  (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V3QeJTnTWgqiTzfppogLkQrPKv7yuyDKBz7aS_FWo2k/edit#gid=0)

Team Work & Leadership:
I have also helped support and encourage the team throughout many efforts.  One example of this was code red.  During this time our team put in lots of extra hours to cleanup code, and improve the MP system.  The MP team worked to the spirit of this task, and didn't just settle for the minimal effort to get out of code red.  We put in many long days and lots of extra hours on the weekend to improve error handling, and code quality.  There were a number of times the Motion Planning team was complemented for the efforts put in during code red, and for the quality of work done.

The 3/29 demo effort was another great example of a great team effort.  Through this time I encouraged lots of on vehicle testing and time at New Stanton.  I helped the team through a six week period where very little sleep happened and nearly every waking moment was spent working to improve intersections, and bring up a whole new capability (Lane changes).  During this time I took on most AI support and fixes in order to allow the team to focus on developing and testing the new features.  Through this amazing effort the team was able to develop solid, although still MVP, capabilities for intersections and lane changes.  As a team we also ensured that we designed the lane change effort with an eye to the future, not just a hacky solution that would get us through the demo.   I feel I have done a good job helping the team balance rapid feature development with long term solutions.

As a contributor I can count on his opinion when working AI issues.  I often defer to his experience when making software architecture decisions.  Early in the review cycle, I relied on Tom as a reader, which helped me to improve my own C++ skills.

As a leader Tom has put together a congruent and motivated team.  There plan is well communicated such that is it easy for my to plan my own teams activities such that the MP&C greater team performs well.  

Tom and I have developed a strong working relationship.  We often discuss issues relevant to both the MP and MC team.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,report,"Tom has done an excellent job managing a team that's been getting larger and is across two offices.  He holds meetings every week to cover sprint reviews for the past week and planning for the following week.  He has a very good estimate as to how much we can get done and what is reasonable for us to complete.  He keeps the atmosphere jovial and positive but also keeps the meeting on track.

Tom often allows us to focus on code development and will address field issues, either determining a fix, working with us to find a fix, or doing triage and assigning a ticket to us. This was especially true during code red as he was shielding us from field issues and allowed us to focus on development. 

Tom does more than manage workloads and oversee the team. He has a good overview of the technical approaches we are taking and with his experience knows if there are corner cases we are likely to come across.  He does a good job balancing technical debt with feature development. With all of the managing he does, he doesn't micro-manage.  He gives us self-autonomy to determine what features are important or are needed near-term, and to adjust the schedule accordingly.

",,,Ramadev Hukkeri,rhukkeri@argo.ai,Tom Petroff,tpetroff@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Tom has built and led a team that is talented, thoughtful, and collaborates well with one another and other teams. When I introduced changes to the PoseInterface API that required consumers to adapt, individual teams took on the responsibility for issuing PRs to adapt to the new API. Motion Planning worked as a very cohesive group to adapt their code to these changes, being one of the only teams to actively ask questions about the finer points of the changes, request features, and build consensus on their usage of this library. These changes happened in the midst of Code Red, and the ability of the team to adapt to additional work is admirable. The team also has demonstrated willingness to lend a hand when other teams are encountering issues. I personally had difficulty with a motion planning unit test during Code Red, and a motion planning team member volunteered to stay late (~2AM) with me to help triage/debug the issue. This speaks to the positive culture of the team built under Tom's leadership, and impact at a much wider scope. Tom and his team also have developed a very disciplined approach to testing changes, which has helped minimize the number of surprises in landed software, as well as ensuring the team is well grounded in understanding how changes impact.

To be clear, the only reason I'm not scoring a 5 in this review is because I haven't had the opportunity to work with Tom directly on enough projects for me to be able to provide detailed concrete examples of performance across the full list of expectations for Staff Engineers.",,,Jason Ziglar,jziglar@argo.ai,Tom Petroff,tpetroff@argo.ai,Software,

I was given work to do right away, but also given support while learning things like our API and the PR/merge process. Tom meets with each team member 1-on-1 biweekly for individual feedback. This is really helpful since I am still learning a lot.

Tom (and Al Costa) organized a recreational activity after the last big demo push, which was good for team-building and fraternity.

Tom keeps our JIRA work tickets in order and sets quarterly plans for when projects will be completed and how they interact. Code cleanup is scheduled along with new development.

Tom has assigned to me many tasks involving the route planner. This has given me the opportunity to become familiar with this particular part of our system and to drive development of new features for it. I think Tom's assignment of tasks like this is helping me contribute more to the code base than if my assignments were scattershot. That said, Tom also occasionally assigns to me other tasks, so that I can also begin to acquaint myself with the other parts of the code our team owns.",,,John Drake,jdrake@argo.ai,Tom Petroff,tpetroff@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,report,"Tom has done a great job managing a growing motion planning team. His leadership and management skills have improved over the last 6 months. He has put more effort into making roadmaps and quarterly plans to keep us on task and on schedule. He has continued to lead weekly backlog grooming and planning meetings so that everyone on the team knows how to manage their time.

I appreciate that Tom has advocated that we scope time for refactoring and improving our existing code rather than solely pushing for new features. This may cause short term delays in new feature development, but it is essential to maintain our pace long term and prevent “code red” emergencies.

One major example is lane changes. Tom pushed back on writing a hacked lane change solution that we’d have to throw away soon afterward. He gathered the senior members of the team and over a few long meetings we hammered out an MVP lane change implementation that we could build on.

As Tom’s management responsibilities have increased, he’s had less time to write code. Even reviewing code is too time consuming at this stage. But, he is still thoroughly familiar with the codebase. He initiates design discussions and provides feedback. He’ll still take Autonomy Integration tickets on occasion and is effective at troubleshooting problems and identifying solutions.

Tom is personable and respectful to everyone on the Motion Planning team. He never belittles or berates. He is always approachable with any concern. To get the motion planning team to put in our best effort, he leads by example. For example, he stayed till midnight to test at New Stanton in preparation for the 3/29 demo. ",,,Neal Seegmiller,nseegmiller@argo.ai,Tom Petroff,tpetroff@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,report,"In primarily a managerial role now, Tom has improved greatly with better scoping and long term planning for the whole. This does mean that there are times when Tom spends most of his time in meetings/planning, so actual code contributions are now mostly limited to small features and bugfixes.  However, one of the most helpful things is how active he has been in triaging autonomy integration and fleet issues, which shields the rest of his team from constant context switching, which would slow down development. Tom is the primary point of contact for the motion planning team from external team members. He has a good overall understand of how the whole MP stack works and is a great person to talk about more detailed designs with as he usually has insightful comments.

Tom has been great in encouraging his team members to design different parts of the system, and has also been trusting enough in our abilities and the designs to enable us to lead the presentations of these to upper management. He has encouraged his engineers to take in active part in design meetings. Examples: (1) inviting me to the PredictionInterface design review, (2) having Neal lead the lane change design review with upper management, and (3) having me lead the mover decision module with upper management. Similarly, he encouraged Neal, Ramadev, and I to step up as code owners and readers, putting his trust in us as he could no longer be the reader to review every PR.

Over the past 6 months, our sprint planning has gotten a lot better, which is impressive considering that our team has also doubled in size. As a team, we’re still not always accurate at time estimates; however, with Tom’s leadership we have gotten better at scoping out a sprint and trying to stick to that goal.

----
Given in Tom’s self review; nothing to add.

Where has Tom grown?
----

* Has I think become a better listener than he used to be; more tolerant of complexity in a management situation 
* Got better at planning long term. Better at scheduling and organizing meetings - with the new flexible bi-weekly format. Evidence: we had a relatively better time during code red and the race to the Demo than other teams.  
* Sprints feel much more doable now. The estimates are better, and there are more hands to share the workload. We collectively realize our sprint goals more closely than we used to.

How has Tom supported my professional growth?
----

It was good to check in with him frequently late last year during the debugging of so many issues. It was a very stressful time, given that everyone was complaining that I was slow, and it was hard to meet / Zoom with Pittsburgh folks on time because of the time zone difference and the difference between slack and a face to face meeting.
",,,Ganesh Peruvemba Kumar,gkumar@argo.ai,Tom Petroff,tpetroff@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,report,"Tom does a good job to advocate for the motion planning team to upper management and to insulate our team from the bureaucracy. He listens to our goals and ideas, and lets us lead the development plan as much as possible.

Tom is personable and approachable. He provides good feedback on my progress through one-on-one meetings.

His support for his direct reports has helped four of us become C++ readers, which is an unusually high proportion compared to other teams. The Motion Planning team is recognized throughout the organization for high quality code, and that reputation comes from enforcing and believing in high standards. Those standards come from all of us, but Tom leads by example, and he supports efforts to maintain and improve the quality of our code.

In my short time on the Motion Planning team, we've grown from 7 members to 10.  Tom has adapted well to the increase in team size and work load. We continue to move forward rapidly and maximize the usefulness of all members of the team by sharing tasks and working in parallel.

In addition to his full time management job, Tom's technical skill allows him to jump in to fix bugs that come to us from the Autonomy Integration team. This keeps us free to work on new development and was instrumental in our ability to deliver the lane change feature.",,,Ed Venator,evenator@argo.ai,Tom Petroff,tpetroff@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Tom is a great leader for the motion planning team.  He is the driving force behind the creation of the  team's sprint and quarter level plans as well as the execution of those plans. At the same time Tom is not afraid to get his hands dirty.  During both ""code red"" and the push to get lane changes integrated for the 3/29 demo, Tom was working with his team late into the evening and over the weekends to ensure that delivery dates were not missed and that the quality of the features being delivered were high. In addition to SW development Tom has also done a great job with developing his motion planning team.  Tom has grown his team by 150% and he has still been able to maintain a high standard for his code quality while still maintaining the close knit bond throughout the motion planning team.

Tom's reach within Argo is more broad than just the motion planning team.  Tom regularly meets with Motion Control, Simulation, Prediction, and STS to share information and help adjust other teams plans to ensure that the organization is delivering on our objectives.  During these meetings Tom is able to sell his approach to a problem, gain cross team buy-in and align plans for delivery.

Within Argo Tom is seen as the master of the Motion Planning domain.  Tom is able to keep tabs on everything that is going on within the team of 9 developers and speak to the status at a moments notice.  As an example:  Tom is frequently a participant in the AInt meeting in which he has always been able to provide status on any new, open, or blocking issues.

As the lead of motion planning Tom has had the responsibility to deliver substantial features.  His team was responsible for delivering the first version of intersection logic, prediction V0, veering, lane changes, to name a few.  Tom truly had driven forward, with his quiet leadership, the capability of the Argo AV.",,,Mike Lambert,mlambert@argo.ai,Tom Petroff,tpetroff@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,report,"Tom has been my manager for the following projects:
* Publish traffic signal set state that MP looks at
* Profiling metrics
* Lane change metrics
* Trajectory/CorridorMap validity checking
* Route progress metrics

Tom triages bug reports and routinely discerns whether a bug resides in MP code or another team's, e.g., mapping, MC, prediction, sim, etc.  He is an authority on the integration of these various systems.  He even uncovered the core temperature issues that had deleterious knock-on effects on MP runtimes.

He clearly communicates updates to meetings and has a clear agenda for each meeting.  I almost never feel that there is dead time in meetings he runs.

Tom rigorously sticks to the process in our flavor of Agile development.  Tasks are almost always estimated and scheduled in a sprint, with due consideration given to each engineer's capacity.

Tom scopes tasks well.  I will sometimes have an impulse to over-engineer a problem, when the priority is to get something simple landed with less schedule risk, and Tom does a good job of resisting that scope creep.

As Tom's direct report, I feel in control of my professional development.  I feel that if there is something in particular that I want to work on, I have wide latitude to steer my work in that direction.  At a day to day level, this comes through in the fact that in our team there is deference to the individual contributors to create our own JIRAs, and that will often guide the next week's sprint.  At a higher level, Tom asked me multiple times during my onboarding what I'd like to work on, and likewise has at least once asked the team to provide input on what tasks need doing (e.g., during the ""free week"" at the quarter boundary).

We have 1:1s every other week and I always feel like I have Tom's ear.",,,David Breeden,dbreeden@argo.ai,Tom Petroff,tpetroff@argo.ai,Software,

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,report,Tom is already growing and improving as a manager. My only recommendation is to mentor other senior members of the motion planning team to grow into leadership roles too. This will be necessary as the team continues to grow and the management burden increases. Some of the sprint planning and roadmap work can be delegated for example. Other team members can lead design meetings with higher ups (we already do this).,,,Neal Seegmiller,nseegmiller@argo.ai,Tom Petroff,tpetroff@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,report,"We could probably do to improve the efficiency of sprint planning meetings. This has been getting better recently with more pre-planning. However, there are still times where we probably spend too much time discussing a single issue that affects only a couple team members. Encouraging some of these discussions to go off-line when possible, would probably speed up our meetings.

Tom is great at communication with the team in Pittsburgh. However, my estimation is that more could be done to make the Mountain View contingent more integrated with the rest of the team team. This is not all on Tom. It’s on the team as a whole. However, as the manager of the group, Tom likely has the most power to improve this, probably through more active encouraging of those members to speak up more during meetings and design discussions, review more PRs, etc.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,report,"Tom has done a great job with managing the team and interfacing with other teams but I think his insight into the current code of the MP stack has gone down.  Since he has been involved with other things it's not certain if or how he can be more involved with the code that is being developed and landed. It may be the natural progression to see less of the code and focus more on how it works, limitations, and behaviors versus the minuteia of the implementation.  But seeing that we're just partly through year two it may benefit us to have oversight of the code from a unifying source.

What are some areas where your manager can grow and improve?
---

* The estimates we make are often very poor and little more than random guesses. E.g. the more description an issue has, the more story points we often naively assign to it. Issues with little description other than a terse summary get assigned fewer points.  I have lost faith in the story point system and its force fitting to the Fibonacci number system.

Tom, surely you realize the kernel of truth behind my statements How do you expect us to be better at estimating our tasks if we stick to such a system? Sure, our system serves us now; but often the story points are chronically underestimated. Let me ask you: what improvements to our current Agile system have you learnt of? Are you of your own accord improving on your understanding and implementation of the Agile system?  


Here are several pain points I've experienced, which I only hope you understand, let alone address 

* Until @dbreeden joined, I was the only engineer in MTV. Nov/Dec '17 were months of hell - often the communication gap / lack of context between Pit and MTV was too large to bridge over Slack or Zoom, leading to you folks complaining that I was slow.I think you took a one sided view claiming that I was just slow of my own accord, leading to a huge accumulation of comments on my issues, etc.

Now that I've grown a little older in the company, I can authoritatively claim (FWIW) that some issues do take a lot of back and forth; e.g. MP-2006 required a sub-issue (MP-2090) to be raised to create a new map interface for subroute corridor, and it wasn't at all obvious or transparent from @nseegmiller's design doc. It took multiple Slacks, Zooms, and PR comments to fix the issue. I don't see a quicker and easier route to the problem - often the solution details, such as the function prototype and test cases are changed *after* raising the PR, and not before. This perforce means that landing the PR is delayed as clarifications accumulate. Another e.g.: @jdrake's recent PR #4959; despite the close guidance of @nseegmiller, it *still* suffers from style issues and has a massive slew of PR comments. 


Further, the team is confused at times over what convention to follow; take e.g @evenator's comments on whether or not shared ptrs should be null-initialized. I've also had to frequently ask clarifications on #sw-eng to my PR comments. All this doesn't diminish the confusion. I feel that amid all the clamor and confusion, clarifying and re-clarifying one's goals, no matter what the # of PR comments it takes, is the only way to go. For example, MP-2090 was a huge step towards clarifying MP-2006 and its derivative PRs. The way there was certainly not pleasant, but it's a significant step given the ambiguity it cleared away. 

On the other hand in issues where there's relatively little ambiguity (e.g. MP-1246, MP-1573) there is corrrespondingly little accumulation of comments on my PR. 


(Aside: My own experience has led me to give @dbreeden and @cmcalister a better one than I had. I am generally available to help them, and I talk to them directly for PR comments. The discussions I had with @cmcalister regarding the multi-threaded test case for Traffic Lights was I feel a huge help to him.  A number of PR comments can be settled over face-face discussion in a way that nothing else helps. )


* At the risk of my asking again- readership and the opportunity to take interviews. While I understand your earlier concerns, once again I don't agree with them entirely- see my comments  above. 


* While you were debugging the Turn signals, your quick fix for the case where the lane turns after the lane change was to have a max distance equal to ""9999.99"". Again, your situation is understandable, but you're creating a poor example for everyone else. Had I raised a PR like that I'd have got immediately knocked down for poor style

He's always one of the first to triage problems on the #build or #sw-eng channel, with amazing communication to the org of what's going on. TR has found quite a few deep rooted bugs that were not easy to see out right. He's able to do this because of his calm demeanor, and determination to understand the details/root of the problem.

Technically TR continues to excel, learning new skills in the range of language we need to know at devops. I've seen improvement in:
* CMake, helping me review CMake requests and add new features
* Python - demonstrating well written and organized python code with quick turn around
* C++ - Beginning to dive into deeper language capabilities such as move operators and child process handling

TR is an amazing communicator. He consistently sends informative emails and messages out to the org when issues occur, and maintains a polite and helpful rapport with developers when they ask questions. TR is also a great rubber ducky. When discussing technical design with TR, he asks specific questions which help guide your thought process, focus on the issue at hand.

This has been a great asset to me and together we support each other and help relieve pressure of maintaining a robust CI and development environment.  I know that in my absence, TR is completely capable of maintaining CI, troubleshooting, and managing the workload expected in our high pressure environment.  As TR has pointed out, he has grown in his short time as a developer here and has contributed to many areas that support the team and organization.  As TR pointed out, I was able to hand off the Test Framework design (with help from TR) and code, where TR was able to pick up the work and finish it off.  He spent some time ramping up on C++, which is an area that he hasn't worked on much in his career and still deliver a finished product.  Outside of project work, I like to hear TR's feedback and input during meetings with myself and other developers about various projects.  TR brings some unique experience with him and most of his comments are delivered in a calm and respectable tone, which is very refreshing in an environment where many developers have strong feelings on many subjects.  In, closing, I enjoy working with TR,  and look forward to continue to work with him as he continues to grow out his skillset and takes on more projects and responsibilities.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"**Notable Contributions and Organizational Impact**

One of my first projects was to make improvements to the Argobot merge queue. The first round of improvements allowed the merge queue to work more fluidly with the organization's transition to a monorepo. The improvements included supporting multiple users being authorized to bless PRs, only pulling in base branches when a PR is ready to merge, deleting feature branches once they’ve been merged, and setting up a Dockerfile to improve local development. I’ve also added the collection of statistics so that we can continuously monitor how many PRs are being landed by the bot and how quickly they’ve landed. My contributions and in depth understanding of the bot have made me a point person for Argobot. The improvements made to the Argobot merge queue have vastly improved how much code we are able to land.

Another major project that I’ve contributed to is the MVP for the Test Framework. The  Framework started with a thorough design doc co-authored by Jason and I. Designing this system required us to take into account how this framework would interact with each team in the AV stack. Since our user pool included the entire AV org, we made sure the design doc was presented to the entire software organization. Improving my C++ skills has been an important goal of mine from the start of my time at Argo, so I was extremely excited to stand up the first pass of the framework as it allowed me to fine tune these skills. Due to that time restraint, we were sure to include the features that would be of the highest value to those who would interacting with the framework. All of the features of the framework that been implemented have unit test setup. This MVP of the framework gives the organization a unified way to implement unit and integration tests. It has also improved build speeds by 20% by implementing a single point library to link against.

One of our team’s Q1 OKR was to improve build times, but before we could tackle that we needed to benchmark what we already had. In January, I added the ability for the team to track information around our build scripts. Information that we’re now able to collect includes build times, cache hits, and failed builds. Being able to gather this data has allowed us to actively monitor the health of our systems, and gives us the ability to track the progress of our systems as we continue to improve upon them. Without these statistics, we would be blind to issues in our build system.

One of the latest tasks I’ve worked on is the design doc for automating the Argobuilder image. Automating this process has been an action item I have long been eager to tackle because early on in my time at Argo, I noticed how tedious the process could be. Due to complexity of the system, the process would need to be thoroughly vetted which is why it is one of my more recent projects and not something I was able to fix as soon as I noticed the inefficiency. I am confident my recent design doc proposes a process that vastly improves the release workflow. I have an Epic for this work to be queued up in a future sprint.

As a key member of the RAD team, I’ve become the go-to person for everything build related, including our scripts, build systems, and CI/CD. This responsibility requires me to balance my time across my multiple projects, while also providing support in #build and #infrastructure channels. In addition, since there’s a limited number of members on our team, I try to put aside at least an hour a day to provide code feedback for my coworkers.

**Communication**
Communication at Level 4 requires that I will regularly present results and progress to the team. During our daily scrums, as well as our sprint plan meeting, I am currently communicating with my team the progress of my work so that we can properly plan our work for the ongoing and upcoming sprints.

I provide feedback to my coworkers about possible improvements that they can make to their current approaches that I think would be beneficial. I am, in turn, open to constructive criticism and outside ideas from them that will allow my work to be of a greater benefit or will allow me to become more efficient in what I’m working to accomplish. 

Through my work on the design docs for the Testing Framework and Argobuild release I have shown that I’m able to consistently provide well thought out documentation.

**Team Work**
Part of L4 requires fostering a one team attitude to bring peers together. I bring a positive attitude to scrum every day, and am very comfortable providing my coworkers with positive feedback. Also, as stated previously, I like to encourage open exchanges with the members of our team. Sometimes making time during a very busy or hectic day to provide code feedback for my coworkers can be tricky, but doing so is a very important part of our team dynamic and to ensuring we’re putting out the best possible work.

**Leadership**
L4 engineers are required to mentor junior developers on the basics over our broader system. Although the team does not have a lot of junior engineers, we recently absorbed new members from other teams within the organization. During their transition phase, I helped in providing guidance and insight when needed about different aspects of our build system including the build scripts, Jenkins, Incredibuild, and Argobot. In the future, if the opportunity arises, I would excited to take on the responsibility of mentoring junior developers

I also lead an onboarding class in which I am responsible for educating new developers about our build infrastructure and introducing them to the different tools and resources available to them.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,report,"Since Wahid and I started at Argo a week apart we have been working closely to come up to speed on Argo projects and how the supply management function can work together with engineering and hardware development. We've collaborated to cover all the VDS modules being produced and I appreciate the direction and insight Wahid has provided in helping me come up to speed and provide specific analysis of the AVS ESOW quotes we received from suppliers. 

We have regular 1:1's and Wahid is good at keeping me informed about other areas going on within supply management that I may not be seeing on a day to day basis. He makes me feel like I am a valued member of the team and organization.

I especially appreciate that Wahid is supportive of recognizing accomplishments and generously shares credit and highlights cost savings that I provided to execs.",,,Mark Freeman,mfreeman@argo.ai,Wahid Umerani,wumerani@argo.ai,Hardware,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"1. Build Appropriate Organizational Relationships: Since starting in Dec'17, one of my immediate focus was to start building effective relationships cross-functionally to help manage projects/critical issues and drive to closure. This was both internal and external to Argo, including hierarchical relationships.
   a. Argo: Wesley Ford and his HW Leads, Mark Itzler's LiDAR team, SW Team (Ersin & Staff), Legal Team, Procurement, Finance team, Business & Strategy team
   b. Ford: Purchasing (Brian Stidham, Pete Hockey), PMT6 (Colm, Heidi & her entire team), Chief Program Engineer (Chris Brewer)
   c. Suppliers: Autoliv/Veoneer, Magna, Nvidia, Intel, Velodyne, other Tier 2 partners

2. Team Recruiting & Growth: Added strong and complementary GSM talent to the Supply Chain & Mfg team. Also, provided opportunities/guidance for team member to demonstrate growth and organizational recognition.
   a. LiDAR GSM:  Recruited and hired Larry Hicks to support Argo LiDAR team in New Jersey. This is a critical hire with deep technical and commercial experience. Clearly communicating to him short term and long term supplier engagement and their priorities (eg SRI, Moog, etc).
   b. Team Structure: Dedicated approach in the team given the complexities of VDS modules, eg having Mark Freeman totally focus on AVS module to drive supplier management issues with Autoliv/Kontron/Dornerworks/PPI/ etc. While I focused on managing all the other modules (Camera Modules, Radar, LiDAR, etc). As time elapsed and organization becoming more efficient, offered Mark to manage CMS module. Similarly, utilized Shemin's resource in NJ office to manage supply chain and manufacturing issues related to Argo LiDAR.

3. Dual Role of Team Manager & IC:
   a. Team Manager: Specific examples are:
       -  Direction for the team as mentioned in 2b above.
       -  Establishing priorities and follow thru with Mark on AVS quotes related to Z1, Z1.5, and Z2 (Flex)
       -  Developing Z2 ESOW plan/schedule for all VDS modules (Q2'18 completion)
       -  Proactively Identify Supplier Challenges:  128A LiDAR execution, AR1212 (12MP imager) readiness
   b. IC Role: Specific examples are:
       -  SRI (ROIC Development): Led and drove ISA/SOW/Term Sheet to negotiate terms on NRE Pricing, Royalty, IP rights, Indemnification
       -  Magna: Tenaciously challenging supplier multiple times on their quotes, Phase 1, for visibility to aggressively drive ED&T charges. Phase 1 was quoted at $3.81M ED&T, brought it down to $2.66M. Recommended internal syncs with Ford ahead of weekly meetings with Magna.
       -  Keeping Suppliers Honest/Tow the Line: ED&T analysis on HC, Tooling, Certification Charges etc with Autoliv and Magna
       -  128i: Eliminated Argo's ED&T for 128i LiDAR by taking up the case with Veoneer & Ford, convincing them them Argo should not pay any ED&T for standard product. Initiated 18-24 month warranty request with Veoneer & Ford. Response time on returned units.

4. Tools and Reporting Dashboard:  Worked with Finance team to develop spend analysis & forecasting dashboard for Bryan and his executive staff. This provides actual and forecast spend for each VDS module and Tier 1 suppliers.

5. Argo LiDAR RFP: Began leading the RFP effort for Argo LiDAR, in order to pitch to a Tier 1 partner. Early work started in Feb'18.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Wahid has been a valuable partner over my first several months at Argo, assisting in a number of ways in our relationships with Magna and OnSemi. His proactive approach to communication with counterparts at Ford, Magna, and OnSemi has helped build stronger relationships between our companies.

Recently, Wahid drove commercial discussions on the thermally invariant camera ESOW, helping to extract information from Magna and challenge their quotes, which were significantly incomplete. This involved multiple rounds of back-and-forth calls with Magna's commercial account manager and the wider Magna management team, including while Wahid was out on vacation.

Internally, Wahid's collaborative approach to supplier engagement has kept all members of our team constantly aware of status and progress on top issues. I appreciate the clear effort Wahid makes to inform me of any relevant conversations he has had with our suppliers or other stakeholders at Argo on a timely basis.

He's had a swift and immediate impact on tracking and coordinating numerous issues and challenges across the supply base.  This has offloaded much work from the eng team allowing them to be more effective.  Wahid has communicated the really big issues effectively and I'm thankful for his overall proactive nature.,,,Bryan Salesky,bsalesky@argo.ai,Wahid Umerani,wumerani@argo.ai,Hardware,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Wahid is a seasoned player in the GSM domain and has been very effective in supporting the Argo LiDAR team on a number of fronts.  In particular, for the past several months, I have had frequent interaction with Wahid in the context of (i) negotiating a development and supply contract with SRI for a CMOS readout integrated circuit (ROIC) and (ii) preparing an RFP for potential manufacturing partners for the Argo LiDAR.  He has also been preparing the GSM team for a significant role in supporting the Argo LiDAR product, including a critical hire dedicated to our effort.

- Wahid has worked diligently to build consensus among the diverse group of Argo team members representing various domains (legal, finance, BD, technical, etc.) that are necessary in supporting GSM activities; specifically, I have worked with him closely in the context of the SRI ROIC development contract and the Argo LiDAR manufacturing RFP.  He took ownership of the overall effort and has effectively engaged and organized input where needed from the other teams.
- Wahid displayed a calm, collected approach to tense negotiation situations at various points in the negotiation with SRI.  In particular, the lead negotiator for SRI lost his cool at a critical point of negotiating milestones and payment schedule, and Wahid employed an effective strategy of refusing to escalate the tension and letting his counterpart know they could re-engage only when he cooled off.  This brought SRI back to the table to satisfactorily resolve this point of contention and proceed through other issues to close the deal.
- Wahid adopted a very pragmatic approach to negotiating the SRI development contract.  He managed to push down the cost of the development program by >$200K but made what I believed to be an appropriate assessment that this program cost could not be squeezed further.  And while he was highly sensitive to long-term costs in the form of license royalties, he made what I felt was an appropriate trade-off (i.e., agreeing to a 2.5% royalty rate) and used smart negotiating tactics to reduce upfront cash outlay for the background IP license to $0 (!).
- He exhibited highly responsive follow-through on activities related to developing the RFP for potential LiDAR manufacturing partners.  Although it took time to pull together the relevant content for the RFP, his information distribution and communication with other team members was always rapid.
- Wahid was pro-active in recognizing the breadth of support that will be needed for supporting vendor interactions for the Argo LiDAR team, and he defined a new GSM role that was quickly filled with a great hire.",,,Mark Itzler,mitzler@argo.ai,Wahid Umerani,wumerani@argo.ai,Hardware,

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"- The Argo LiDAR product will have a challenging BOM and supply base to manage given that our suppliers span a spectrum that includes III-V semiconductor wafers and wafer processing foundries; silicon foundries; suppliers of custom optical, mechanical, and electrical components; board assembly and other sub-assembly integrators; and a manufacturing partner to take ownership of the entire product delivery.  This breadth of vendors represents a wide range of different technologies, and Wahid and his team will need to sufficiently master suppliers where they may not have extensive experience.

- The LiDAR team has a growing number of team members that will have extensive interaction with our vendors, particularly due to the highly custom nature of many of the parts that we must have developed and procured.  Coordination between our team members and Wahid’s GSM team will be critical to achieving the best possible outcome for the LiDAR development.  In particular, Wahid and I should push forward with defining the most productive structure for deploying Shemin in supplier-related activities.",,,Mark Itzler,mitzler@argo.ai,Wahid Umerani,wumerani@argo.ai,Hardware,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,manager,"Need Wahid to lean in and push back on suppliers.  Our eng team gets very quiet on supplier calls when they experience push back on our requirements or requests.  Need Wahid to work across all levels of management to influence them and negotiate a solution that works for all parties.  So far I've seen Wahid do a lot of tracking/coordination, but as he gets more comfortable, looking for Wahid to step into a role where he has the relationships to call the right executive and get things done for us.

Secondly, we need Wahid to watch over pricing and set aggressive targets and report back to my leadership + Ford when we aren't making the progress needed.  The commercial aspect of our deals is often time ambiguous due to the nature of custom development, but seeing a roll up of the targets he's setting and working toward would put everyone on the same page and manage expectations.",,,Bryan Salesky,bsalesky@argo.ai,Wahid Umerani,wumerani@argo.ai,Hardware,

Though not an area that has thus far been lacking, I would appreciate Wahid's assistance in gaining clarity on how the upcoming ESOW, SOBA, and quoting processes intersect, and which will be driven by Argo vs Ford. I could see this becoming a point of contention in the Ford/Argo/Magna relationship, and from my experience Wahid is well-equipped drive this process and clarify respective roles & responsibilities to ensure a smooth transition into Z2.",,,Koji Gardiner,kgardiner@argo.ai,Wahid Umerani,wumerani@argo.ai,Hardware,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"I would encourage Wahid to be even more assertive with internal and external partners. In private one on one dialogue with me, Wahid clearly demonstrates that he understands where are partners are failing us and how the Argo-Vendor commercial dynamic should function. However, I do not always see Wahid making a dominant stand for Argo’s needs with our partners. Our more aggressive partners like Magna will steamroll us if we do not have an assertive, yet professional commercial team.

I encourage Wahid to proactively develop more tools to track and report work in progress on his team. For example, we have a growing number of Tier 1 Z2/J1 deals in negotiation today. There is not yet a central tracker for all of the deals, so the Hardware Team constantly has to search email attachments to find the relevant commercial details from deals in progress.

I encourage Wahid to focus more of his attention on our outside partners. I noticed that even Wahid’s self review primarily focuses on topics related to Argo/Ford internal activities, but I vision Global Supply Management to be a role primarily focused on our outside vendors.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"We put WeiWei in a somewhat tough spot by hiring him to be the first team-member out in MTV.  I think that the first month or two were a little rough in that we asked him to do a number of things that were outside of his comfort zone (e.g. the original python map-publishing scripts were a little rough).  However, since he's really started to get more comfortable with his role and broadened his understanding of the whole system, I think things have gone much better.

Specifically, I now consider WeiWei to be a valuable contributor across the stack from map-server backend improvements to publishing scripts to production work.  In a lot of ways, I'm sure he has a better understanding of our systems than I do and I've been here longer.

He also finds bugs in my PRs which is always appreciated (I like a good thorough review as much as the next guy).",,,Matt Gilson,mgilson@argo.ai,WeiWei Kang,wkang@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"I worked with WeiWei a lot in operations capacity, working within the confines of the map build pipeline that I devised. He took ownership of some of the work that I had been dealing with for a long time, finally giving me a chance to pass that knowledge to another team member.

So from my perspective WeiWei's accomplishments were geared towards ownership of map production.  Given the nature of how nascent the process was and how non existent documentation really was, I think WeiWei did a pretty good job of taking over map production. He pitched in to steady the ship and give us some breathing room to make things better and more reliable. He did a much better job than me at being explicit about creating tickets and documentation, something we had been doing a bad job about for a long time.

WeiWei has improved in his knowledge of how the map build pipeline works, how to run the tools, and how to interact with Airflow.

He did a good job of being positive when saddled with a very unreliable pipeline and barebones. It would be easy to complain in that situation but he never really did.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"WeiWei is communicative, helpful, and easy to work with.  His willingness to jump in and put out a fire is unparalleled.  Or, just as importantly, to stop and explain the how and the why of a technical action, rather than just moving forward.

There have been many occasions that I have asked WeiWei to work late or over a weekend in support of the mapping team and he's always done so willingly.  

Examples:
- We released the Westborn area as a map that was separate from Commerce and had to immediately unify them on one map.  It was a Saturday morning, early east coast time and even earlier on the west coast.  WeiWei was awake and working on a plan and technical process to unify the map.  He worked with me to ensure that my tickets were clear and concise, and that they contained enough information that they'd be easily understood by anyone who looked at them.  He then carefully dissected quite a few historical tickets of map builds, publishes, and warps to ensure that the right maps and logs were being used to make the unified map.
- On several occasions WeiWei has  been quick to help, but even quicker to educate other on what he's doing.  He's put together documentation and training sessions for other members of the LME team so that they may help with the work load.
-  I often ask WeiWei for a one-off KML or map link.  He's never once batted an eye or acted as if I've interrupted him, even though I surely have.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"1. Delivered proof of concept and first iteration of map publishing feature. Worked with Matt Gilson and Seth Porter to define dataset to export from Postgres and import into sqlite3 database for on-vehicle use. Worked with Bob Hyer to define on-vehicle tile map filesystem structure and export tile layers. Iterated on publishing feature and migrated to Psycopg2+sqlite3 python libraries. The work equipped MAPREP with capability to capture vector and tile map from map server and package into a format readable from av. 

2. Delivered various features on map server backend. Added GUID to vector map entities, lane type to augment lane segment model and managed migration, relative pose constraints entity, first-class pose entity and its integration into pose frames and pose nodes, and capability to query pose node based on ROI of optimized pose. These features enabled enrichment of vector map models, as well as SAIPS map production integration with map server. Also provided occasional help in map server-related infrastructure, such as troubleshoot and re-enable unit test database schema validation.  

3. Drove map schema versioning design, and map levels design with collaboration with SAIPS. Drafted initial version of base map entity design. Reviewed designs such as docker image versioning and maintenance, Airflow task scheduler, etc. 

4. Map production support across all areas of expansion and various stages of pipeline. Worked closely with Seth Porter and John Smodic to devise, execute and support production of Pittsburgh demo area map and subsequent expansion, Dearborn Westborn area extension, as well as New Stanton and Miami maps. Executed and debugged stages of production pipeline: log extraction, segmentation, local alignment, global alignment, tiling, vector map warping, and publishing. Worked with Infrastructure team to add log slicing option into map pipeline and provide parallel speed-up of long logs. Analyzed key step (segmentation) processing time versus log duration. 

5. Made improvements to Airflow tasks as well as front end scripts - early version of publishing on Airflow, CLI helper to generate slicing command, bug fixes on task tracking output, weekly update of log extraction hmi image, etc. Provide feedback to John Smodic and Matt Gilson to identify high priority fix and improvements, resulting in efficient improvement of production pipeline. These efforts facilitated handoff of log extraction, segmentation and local alignment to LMP. 

6. Work closely with Meredith Whitney, Patrick Gray and Jessica Hulings to provide technical support for LMP. Monitored slack channel, provided on-call support, and addressed any production issues pertaining to map build pipeline. Facilitated knowledge sharing and collaboration both within LME and between LME and LMP. 
   
7. Acted as local go-to-person for bringing team member up-to-speed. Walk-through of MAPREP domain knowledge and codebase with Ying Wei, William Maniatty and Kunal Desai. Aggressively involved Kunal in map operations support and assigned tasks for quick learning. 

8. Authored Wiki pages on production issue trouble shooting and useful techniques to increase LME team productivity, including wiki on ""Map Build Task Debugging"", ""AWS Auto Scaling Group"", ""Log Extraction HMI Image Testing and Promotion"" and ""Map Build Docker Images"".

In terms of improvement I made, I have acquired Python skills from near-zero background and contributed to the python codebase. It is an ongoing process and I would keep improving it by learning from exports on our team.",,,WeiWei Kang,wkang@argo.ai,WeiWei Kang,wkang@argo.ai,Software,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Wes has hired capable leads in his team, untiring effort to look for the best talent and keeping “bar” high. Recent examples being Koji as camera tech lead and Eric in the TPM function. My one line to describe Wes is “lead by example”. He expects the best output from his team and he drives it by providing clear direction, empowerment and management support. I have seen this first hand on AVS (eg choice to pivot in favor of Flex) and Camera modules (eg DCRs).

Wes is also very effective in using his interpersonal skills to get proper buy in from cross-functional teams to drive competitive and practical features in the VDS modules, eg Software (Brett B) and Systems Engineering (Matt P) on Z2 ESOWs around Functional Safety.

Wesley is a huge believer in teamwork and fostering cooperative relationships. He is proactive and practical in his approach. This is all from the perspective of driving best (specs, pricing, schedule) for the VDS modules. One example to highlight here is the overall schedule for Z2 ESOWs, getting proper buy in from Argo cross-functional teams and Ford so all are bought in from the start and requirements clear. Very regularly, Wes will ask me for guidance/recommendation on how to approach Tier 1s in order to drive best values for Argo.

Wesley is a clear communicator, providing empowerment and not mircro managing his team and peers. If needed, he is direct to make sure deliverables are clear and no ambiguity on schedule.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,report,"I can only speak about the projects I have interacted with Wesley. 

My role is to support the projects across various sensing functions that need to be completed in a critical timing and be able to fill in and carry out results effectively. 

[Wesley's accomplishment]
**Z2 field of view study**
   Wesley lead the market survey for all types of sensors to understand the pros and cons.
   Pushed for clear documentation on the field of view study
   Initiated communication among team members to clarify the action items  

[My involvement] 
   *There was a need to quickly complete the lidar beam projection simulation to understand whether the scanning lidar is the best candidate to perform the near-field sensing. Wesley assigned me to perform the study.

   *These was a need to sort out the content of the Z2 field of view study. Wesley asked me to review the content and organize the document.

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-OWrEitP5hfVLcc6-VO0dgCBKpCtmZVu-Ro5GCvy-PQ/edit#slide=id.g309ee07b1f_42_0

**Radar project**
   Wesley managed the team resource to ensure completion of milestones such as 
   Verification of Z1 radar performance
   Completion of Z2 radar market survey

[My involvement]
  There was little resource available to work on radar before October 2017. When I joined Argo, Wesley assigned me to quickly complete the Z1 radar verification and generate the radar detection map. Once the Z1 radar verification was completed and the radar technical lead had joined Argo at that time, I handed over the responsibility. 

**Ultrasound project**
  Wesley monitored the project progress closely to ensure required technical skill sets are available to effectively complete the project.

[My involvement]
   When the ultrasound system is ready for verification, there is a need for building a sensor data driver to interpret the analog values and generating 2D plots to demonstrate the dynamic detection. But there is no such skill set available in the ultrasound team. 
    Wesley assigned me to establish the test plan and perform the programming to establish the software tool to evaluate the results. And when the ultrasound technical lead at that time left Argo, I was assigned to serve as the ultrasound technical lead.  
     Even though the Z2 field of view study had determined not to use the ultrasound system for near-field sensing, Wesley had asked me to make sure the ultrasound system can serve as a backup plan.

**Stereo Camera project**
   Wesley made sure that technical leads get the additional resource they need to complete the projects efficiently. 

[My involvement]
   *When the stereo camera pair becomes the major option for the Z2 near field sensing, there is a need to quickly complete the evaluations of various image sensors and the illumination source for dark field sensing. Wesley assigned me to support the camera technical lead to quickly perform verification tests.

   *When it becomes clear that the stereo camera's dynamic tolerance can significantly impact the performance, Wesley asked me to perform the sensor alignment study to quantify the impact. I performed thermal stress analysis for both far-field and near-field stereo camera mount structures to provide a design baseline that minimize the dynamic tolerances. 

**Summary**
In general, Wesley had ensured the transparency of the organization decisions and information flow within Argo. He had grown his responsibility from directly managing a small hardware team to leading the organization with a group of hardware technical leads and technical program managers. 

**How Wesley support my professional growth**
Wesley provided the opportunities for me to 
   *participate in the development of various sensor platforms
   *apply my skill sets in software programming for visualizing sensor performance, designing sensor verification tests, and using multiple simulation tools to perform analyses.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"In the last year since I joined Argo, I was responsible for growing the Argo Hardware Team and managing five VDS development generations from Z0-Rabbit to Z2/J1. I have built a high output team of engineering staff with clear vision and strong execution.

I have served as the hiring manager for nearly all engineers on the Hardware team. I have worked with the recruiting team to develop the ideal hiring plan, job descriptions, interview plans, resume screens, and candidate characteristics for the Hardware Team. I am in constant contact with the recruiting team to ensure that they have the information and support to help bring on superstar engineers. 

I set the Hardware Team overall strategy ranging from the Hardware Team Mission, to quarterly OKRs, to architecture direction, to day by day guidance for managers and individual contributors. I have set aggressive yet attainable goals for our team, and I have led our team to consistently meet around 70% of our OKRs. We have set a dependable long term roadmap of development, and our customers, both Argo Software and Ford, can trust our team to deliver to our promises.

I have pushed the Hardware Team to use a disciplined and diligent approach to prototype development while growing a program from scratch. I have made it a priority for our team to design modules right the first time and to avoid fire drills, beast mode, technical debt, and pivots. We have been detailed in our requirements definition, architecture simulation, design reviews, verification testing, and documentation for a startup team. This has maximized clear communication across the organization, and it has minimized design mistakes over the last year.

My team and I work collaboratively with our various development partners including Argo Software, Argo Sys-Eng, Argo GSM, Argo Lidar, Ford, and our Tier 1 partners. We proactively push information to our key partners. We get broad buy in before locking design direction. And we foster cooperative relationships with our partners. In particular, I have improved my relationship with key Ford leadership to support Argo Hardware’s needs within Ford. I spend a large amount of time in Dearborn, Pittsburgh, and Princeton to foster these relationships.

I have led our team to develop what may be one of the top three most advanced self driving hardware systems in the world. Our internal and external teams have designs for high dynamic range, high resolution cameras. We have one of the highest performing computers in a self driving car. We have high resolution lidar and radar. Our upcoming generations of hardware will continue to push the envelope for L4 autonomy systems with safe, scalable, durable, and cost effective designs.

I have provided a continual role as a mentor and coach for the entire Hardware Team. I meet with leads and individual contributors across the hardware team on a constant basis. I provide insight and advice on designing self driving hardware, working with partners, and simplifying development. I remove development barriers and help marshal resources for my team. I provide career guidance and resources for my team as well. I also provide clear delegation, roles, and responsibilities across the Hardware Team. I have improved the output of underperformers and managed out individuals who were not the right fit for Argo. 

Earlier in 2017 I had other large projects including launching the Argo California office, hiring part of the Ford RIC-PA team, establishing the Hardware Team engagement with Ford/Roush, conducting lidar market technical due diligence for the PLI acquisition, negotiating the Tier 1 deals, and managing the Hardware Team budget.

- defined engineering initiatives (examples: emphasis on test coverage/plans/readiness, requirements definition in JAMA, ESOW structure and content)
- ensured the team is well-resourced (examples: hardware lab/equipment planning, closing key hires, resource allocation)
- provided valuable feedback on designs, test plans, supplier engagement strategies

Wes has been consistently available whenever I have needed to ask a question or request feedback, and gives clear direction and advice when I have needed it, in particular with regard to managing the relationship with Magna and better understanding Ford's perspective on the project and various issues. He has quickly jumped into supplier discussions that required escalation, notably on the temperature invariant ESOW negotiation and recent challenges with my counterpart on the Ford team.

Wes clearly respects those on his team and has asked for feedback and advice from the hardware leads when needed (examples: decision on how to allocate mechanical engineers within the team, decisions on descoping low-value activities to free up resources).

This has been most frequently related to situations involving risk assessment. Either I or a fellow team member will have previously discussed a potential issue with him, come to an agreement as to action and follow-up, and then Wes later acts disappointed or critical as to the agreed-upon progress being made. His reactions feel disproportionately hyperbolic. 

For example, recent delays and risks in embedded software were clearly articulated. When other teams, who are not involved in the work, have criticized progress, Wes has failed to defend his team or prevent inappropriate incident escalation to occur despite the fact that he was both aware of our progress rates and supportive of it. In such circumstances, it feels as though Wes doesn't necessarily have his team's backs; I think, as a leader, he should advocate for his team clearly and consistently.

I want to make sure that I do not let my design team churn on architecture for too long. One regret I have from 2017 was allowing our team to debate specific key decisions in our architecture for too long. Once I see my team debating the same decision for days on end with no incoming new data, I need to force us to make a final decision and move on.

I have had a couple instances of creating challenges during ESOW negotiations. I let the Z1 ESOW definition process drag on too long, and I sent Magna an ESOW with last minute revisions without briefing Magna on the changes. I need to be more careful when I work on ESOWs and I need to leverage our GSM team more for commercial work.

I also, want to use more of my time to escalate blocking issues with vendors. I have found recently that a short escalation call with leadership at vendors can quickly pivot poor support from a vendor into responsive/professional support from vendors.

If I had more time, I'd have been able to support Wes better.

I've seen Wes negotiate ""to the death"", but I don't always see the compromise part.  Some of this might be that I need to make it clear that my expectation isn't that we get everything we want, just that we do our best to find a win win.

My only other request is to get me more of a heads up before things are about to boil over w/ urgent or major program issues -- the magna camera stuff has had a lot of drama over the past six months.  Sometimes I get involved when it's way past due and there's little that can be done.

Wes has improved substantially in how he deals w/ Ford leaders -- he's prepared, with slides that lay out the trades and key decisions that need to be made, along w/ a proposal.

We softened our position once we saw resistance from Magna and Ford as well. In my opinion, we should have stayed firm in our position very tight and willing to yield only we get equivalent favor from Tier 1s.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"I mostly reviewed Bill's work on city archive and LoadVectorMap output comparison and map server features. The comparison tool became part of map publish in the map production pipeline. His work on various pose-related entities are important parts in SAIPS V1.0 integration. He also took an initiative to look at shortening compression time in map publishing, which yielded promising early results. 

I have not yet had the chance to collaborate with Bill on feature development or operations. From the interactions and discussions we had on various topics, I find Bill an eager person, always willing to learn and get to the bottom of things. He also communicates clearly and is considerate of other people's time. ",,,WeiWei Kang,wkang@argo.ai,William Maniatty,wmaniatty@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Shortly after I joined Argo in mid December 2017, I was asked to do a series of tasks focused on visualizing data in different parts of the map build pipeline. I wrote the “log display tool” that took the nav_pvt (gps) channel from the parquet formatted logs (this tool has since been superseded) to allow for quick assessments of log quality prior to expensive segmentation and pose optimization steps.  I also implemented a tool for keyhole markup language.  These tools have involved me in some urgent efforts to analyze map quality issues under tight deadlines.  In the same code base (map_tool), I wrote a tool to detect lane segments with geofences.

Another thread of work was the validation of the exporting of the city_archive.json (the map_server’s exported file format) and the  dump of LoadVectorMap tool. This job involved reworking the AV side code to emit json instead of an ad hoc format and creating a python tool to do the comparison.

Another thread of work has been numerous changes to the map_server.  I added uuids for pose aggregating entities, which was done in support for another project of mine which copies a pose graph without optimized poses (to enable Saips to more easily create cities).  I also added support for ingesting and exporting the layers used in the AllVision demo (and helped to publish the initial round of sample data with Kunal Desai). Additionally, I’ve become involved in some integration work with Blinky (the traffic signal management tool) and the map server to track the the relationship between served signal faces and their status in Blinky’s database.

Although this is still a bit about work in progress, we got some performance improvements in the map publishing workflow.  When working with Kunal on the AllVision demo, we had mistakenly tried to publish a map with extra layers, that made the tile data much larger.  This punished us by making us wait for a long time for the tar command in the map publishing’s capture_and_export.sh script.  Anecdotally I’ve heard that the team wanted to reduce the publish time and the slow tar did not sit well with me.  To test some of my map_server changes, I published some additional maps, could observe the tar was slow.  I tried archiving the tiles without compression and was surprised to see it ran over over 20 times faster.  A quick performance analysis showed that the compression was single threaded and a quick search showed that we could replace it with multithreaded tools.  I managed to identify a modern tool, zstd that ran over 46 times faster on that same small dataset (but for very large datasets that don't fit into memory, the speedup is more like a factor of 11 or so).  This, combined with Seth Porter’s suggestion of removing unneeded layers from our published data is likely to significantly improve our map publication times (the current projection makes this script at least twice as fast).",,,William Maniatty,wmaniatty@argo.ai,William Maniatty,wmaniatty@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"I am only familiar with a very small part of Bill's work since most of what he has accomplished was unrelated to the onboard vehicle code.

LoadVectorMap Tool:

Bill clearly was not familiar with C++, and his approach to the problem using macros was workable and probably the best option when he began the task.

Map Compression:

Bill took the initiative to investigate compression algorithms to speed up map publishing and ran some bench marks to show that zstd would do a good job on the maps.",,,Bob Hyer,bhyer@argo.ai,William Maniatty,wmaniatty@argo.ai,Software,

I also appreciate Bill's views on documentation.  I don't think that we always agree on exactly what functions need to be documented and to what extent, but he adds docs to just about everything in the appropriate language format and that's a good thing.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"When arriving at Argo, I was quite unfamiliar with python (having only used it for small “glue code” projects) and the web services java stack we used.  In fact when I was asked to develop the log display tool, I reverted to using scala for Spark, since I had done spark development before and used scala. In addition I used gnluplot to display the plots.  It became clear that Argo is not a scala shop and I wound up reworking the code to use the preferred tools, python, pyspark and the python plotting libraries.   Although I’m a scala fan, I’m learning Argo’s choice of tools.  Likewise, although I am familiar with core java, I have needed to pick up a number of frameworks that are new to me (Spring, Hibernate and Lombok spring to mind).  I also had a number of setbacks with git, where rebasing followed by a pull (which git suggests) ruins a branch (often requiring far more effort to fix than the initial development).  I’ve learned that argo rebases branches and never merges (which works, but is different from my previous git experience where history rewriting was frowned upon).  In addition, I’ve learned some of the newer C++ features that were introduced since my last large scale C++ work.

I’ve also worked on improving communication with the team.  Some of my earlier efforts made assumptions (like that the most important part of validating the LoadVectorMap output) was as initially geared toward getting a working validator in place, but other requirements were implicit and required nontrivial architectural changes to the solution, including the need to present enumerated values as strings and failing fast rather than attempting to report a more complete list of errors. I should have interviewed the reviewers prior to coding to learn these requirements.  We are revisiting this, and I’m trying to follow the argo design review and process model, it will be interesting to see how that works out.  I also misunderstood how code review works and had some instances of reviews languishing in spite of code being revised to meet reviewer remarks, one happened to a review that would have happened promptly, but the fleet grounding distracted my reviewer, and another happened since a reviewer was under heavy operational load and he got behind in his emails. I’ve been ore vigilant of code reviews, and mark my Jiras to track review activity, and seek to understand the availability of my team mates.  The main issues are to avoid guessing and associated delay.  As a bottom-up thinker/developer, I tend to worry about the details, and am adopting a top-down approach and summarizing the impact.

Finally, I want to talk about some aspirational goals and areas of growth.  I want to be flexible, yet play to my strengths.  I’m now getting some confidence in the map_server, but historically, I’ve had some success at parallel/distributed algorithms, big data and performance analysis.  I have mostly been spared the heavy operational load our team faces, but without exposure to the operational side, it is hard for me to feel where the pain points are (e.g. the slow compression on tar), so it is a good idea to increase my familiarity there.  As my delivery cadence was hindered by some of the learning curve issues mentioned above, but many of these issues are now rectified. I also think that data visualization is critical, if we can’t see data we are unlikely to understand it.",,,William Maniatty,wmaniatty@argo.ai,William Maniatty,wmaniatty@argo.ai,Software,

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"LoadVectorMapTool:

The ASL feature to generate strings for enums automatically was released while this code was in progress and would have been a much cleaner approach. As it stands we have a bunch of macros in the code we need to get rid of and will probably need to go back and rip out the macros at some point. It would have been nice if we had picked up the ASL string generation at the time rather than continuing with the original approach. Also, there is a unit test commented out in the CMakeLists.txt file in VectorMap/tests that seems really odd. That kind of thing should never happen, and when it does it is up to the developer to fix it and not leave it for the next person to figure out what's going on.

MapCompression:

This approach is great for optimizing map publishing. It would have been nice to see some analysis of how compression would help with the entire path from map publishing, to loading the map onto the vehicle and into memory.",,,Bob Hyer,bhyer@argo.ai,William Maniatty,wmaniatty@argo.ai,Software,

Another area is to keep learning the codebase and improving python and Java skills. I think making use of the various wiki pages and map production flowcharts would also be helpful.   

 ",,,WeiWei Kang,wkang@argo.ai,William Maniatty,wmaniatty@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"I think that there are a few areas where Bill can improve though glancing at his self-review, it seems that he is aware of some of them.

Specifically, continuing to ramp to the point of expertise in some of the technologies that we're using would be really helpful for Bill (python, map-server java frameworks, git).  Some specifics here:

* Python environment management.  This is a sticking place for argo as an organization (c'mon Ubuntu!), but it's something that we need to get better at managing.  For Bill, this could mean becoming an expert with venv or it could mean getting good at anaconda.  As a senior engineer though, it'd be great if he could help shepherd along some of the other MTV folks.
* Map-server frameworks.  I think a little while back I fixed a couple issues that happened from PRs that Bill sent out.  This is going to happen to everyone (I'm sure that I've broken things a few times) so I'm not worried about this, but better understanding of exactly what we're doing in these frameworks/annotations would probably have prevented some of these bugs from happening.

The last thing that I'll call out here is on the inter-personal front.  I think that sometimes the way Bill phrases things sounds a little like blaming.  I try to assume that Bill doesn't mean it this way when he says things, but it can sometimes come across this way.

As a concrete example, recently Bill was talking about the comparison work that he's been doing with LoadVectorMap and city archives and he made a comment about progress being slow because nobody ever wrote a test with the pedestrian crossings in a city archive (or something like this).  To be completely transparent, I'm likely the culprit here -- which is why I this comment sticks out in my memory.  However, the comment could have been phrased differently -- e.g. ""It's going a little slower than expected because I had to update some of tests to get the test data that I needed"".  I would also have *really* appreciated if he had looked at the git history and found out that I was the one who didn't write the tests in the first place and given me that feedback in a constructive way (e.g. a private email rather than public shaming :).  Again, I'm not trying to imply that it was Bill's intent to publicly shame whomever didn't add that test data in the first place (me!).  I'm just trying to provide the feedback that he could work on communicating things in a way that there is no question about his intent.

So anyway, I think Bill is getting ramped up, but I think he has a little further to go before performing at the level that we expect from Sr. SWE.",,,Matt Gilson,mgilson@argo.ai,William Maniatty,wmaniatty@argo.ai,Software,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"1. Event based log filtering :
Implemented event-based log filtering on log ingest server from end to end, which includes filtering logic, unit test, events generation through docker invocation, filtering report json file, filtering statistics database, dashboard and datadog monitoring. Since launched in March 9th, we have saved more than 1,900 TB space in S3 and speed upload time by 40%. See dashboard here for more details: http://metrics.argoai.tools/dashboard/270. This project largely reduces the pressure on vehicle infra team to implement event based logging infra on vehicle. The project was done with help of Wen and Yuhang, we worked together to finish implementation, testing, monitoring and deployment. Our team collaboration played a very important role in delivering the final high quality product.  

2. Log processing features:
Implemented several key components that are required by queue-based data processing pipeline. 
I set up AWS SQS log queue which is populated by lambda function trigger by completion of log upload. Also, I implemented livy server client that is used to talk to HDP cluster in order to  submit spark jobs through Restful API. Besides, I also implemented EMR MapReduce job submitter that can submit jobs concurrently while AWS EMR default step function can only submit jobs one by one. All those components are well unit tested, packaged and published to Artifactory.

3. Finder backend/ElasticSearch features:
The work I have done for elasticsearch includes splitting elasticsearch workflow out of the main log processing luigi workflow to not slow down log processing. Besides, I also changed the giant elasticsearch index to date based index, which largely eases the management of indices. We can now easily search for log on a specific date and delete old indices if elasticsearch cluster ran out of space. The daily index creation was achieved by AWS lambda functions.

4. Dropped message finder:
Changed the MR job to extract first 500 bytes data from raw image message in order to get sequence number in message header. Designed database schema to store dropped message info. Wrote backfill script to generates the report for old data. This projected was done in a war room with Manoj and Yuhang within half day. We all devoted ourselves to experimenting,  coding and testing and finished the high priority project in a very short time. 

5.  Ford egress data sharing: 
Implemented a script that slices and copies massive (80TB) data from argoai/snowball to ford egress bucket based on Hadoop MapReduce. This script helps easily sharing data between Argo and Ford.

6. Repo code quality maintenance:
Carefully reviewed PRs from team members and gave out feedback to address code quality and readability. Added several unit tests to offboard repo and implemented common lib for reusing code in luigi workflow and spark jobs.

7. Helped new hires Dan Pan and Vivek to ramp up and helped them debug on their tasks.

2. Xianlei could have done a better job doing post-deployment QA. After code deployment, it is crucial to ensure that the new code works as expected.

He influence extends well beyond the team he works on and his work ethic is difficult to match. When he discovers a problem, he digs into and sacrifices personally to fix it. A perfect example was the bizarre issue regarding compiler flags for avx and eigen alignment that he tracked down to enable his own work to continue, giving up his weekend to analyze the issue until he figured it out. He developed a simulator to establish an optimal design for stereo calibration, taking on work that the calibration team was not able to do. He produced Argo's first real stereo rectification; developed a PoC primal-dual surface regularization algorithm; is nearing completion of Graph Cut surface regularization; and is taking up the challenge of raindrop detection. We regularly rely on Xiaoyan's knowledge of geometric computer vision when engaging with customers such as Ambarella or trying to figure out tricky problems.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Jointed Argo in the end of January, 2018. As the first radar software engineer on-board, several accomplishments have been achieved in the last 3 months:

[1] **Reorganize radar information**:
       Before I joined the company, there was no  official radar engineer. The progress of radar was intermittent and information was scattered everywhere. The first work for me is to reorganize the radar documents and information, so that the radar itself can tell a  comprehensive story. A Confluence page has been built and maintained by me. The radar status and software plan have been updated there. Those organized information is very helpful for cross team collaboration and for upper level management to understand radar status. Many positive feedback have been received.  

[2] **Software architecture and development**:
      Software development took majority of my effort. Radar was not enabled when I joined the company and we have a few software pieces while they did not work as expected. In addition, we do not have a radar software tool to support the work. In the last 3 months, I have designed the radar pipeline architecture (including Radar Decoder Task & Radar Target Extraction Task and related software modules), implemented thousands of lines of C++ codes (including RadarDetection Library, RadarDetectionMessage, Radar Dictionary Library, RadarObservation Library, RadarObservation Message, and refactored radar drivers), and also written some radar software tools (RadarDataConverter, RadarDataAnalyzer, Radar Visualization GUI). Those software architectures and modules are critical to use and understand radar data in our autonomous driving system.

[3] **Cross team collaboration and problem solving**:
       In Argo, radar is covered by multiple teams. Taking responsibilities to collaborate with other teams, I have finished and been working on several critical tasks:
       (3.1) radar test bench setup, validation, and debugging. Worked with hardware team
       (3.2) radar data regression for ESR FRONT data degradation and SRR data missing. Worked with reliability team
       (3.3) radar calibration (finished the rough json setup and the calibration is still on going). Worked with calibration team.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Xiufeng is very dedicated to his work and has strong desire to accomplishment. In the past three months he has done a fair amount of work in bringing the radar infrastructure up, and planning for the longer term development of radar perception. 

Xiufeng can empower team members using his domain knowledge and software development experiences. He understands the big picture and knows how the radar perception needs to interact with other teams such as calibration and hardware. 

I appreciate a lot of helps from Xiufeng to let me quickly setup and start to contribute to the team in the first two months.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Xiufeng was the first to start ingesting radar data on Z0 fleet.  There he discovered many issues that were not validated.  He is working to sort out radar data issues and is instrumental in writing the pipeline for radar data infrastructure ingestion.

Xiufeng also reached out to other teams to help refine the quality of radar data, such as the vehicular ops team and the calibration team.  He also reached out to the hardware team to try to better understand the radar data.",,,Duc Vu,dvu@argo.ai,Xiufeng Song,xsong@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Xiufeng has basically built the entire radar pipeline from scratch by himself, he brought extensive experience and expertise of radar signal processing and probabilistic filtering to Argo. I was also impressed by his dedication of creating comprehensive documentation of the pipeline he works on. His slides, lucid charts and confluence pages are inspiring. 

Xiufeng also collaborates extensively with various teams to make sure the integration of the software goes as smooth as possible. As a quick learner, Xiufeng has mastered Argo's coding convention, message passing system, task framework and testing philosophy within the month he joined, which is no small feat.",,,Xiaoyan Hu,xiaoyan@argo.ai,Xiufeng Song,xsong@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,I think Xiufeng is more familiar with lower level programming languages like C while we use a lot of modern C++ features (C++14/17) which he might need some time to get used to.,,,Xiaoyan Hu,xiaoyan@argo.ai,Xiufeng Song,xsong@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"[1] *Multi-site communication*:
     In Argo, an engineer need to frequently work with peers from a different site and heavily relies on video conferences. Communication skills are critical and this is something that I need to improve. In addition, I need to learn to make a meeting productive. Right now I try to make a meeting single propose and have a clear goal. It becomes better. Will keep improving it. 

[2] *Understanding Argo software infrastructure/design*
     Need to put more time to understand our software architecture and current code implementations. E.g., I have experienced a couple times that I have written a library while somebody have already done it. The duplicate work could be avoided if I get more familiar with our codes.

[3] *Get more time to work on algorithm*
     I used to work in an environment that I focused on algorithm while somebody else help me write framework and pipeline. Right now my effort is completely on framework and pipeline instead. Hopefully, I would put more time to work on data and algorithm after the pipeline is finished and becomes stable.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Xiufeng expertise is in algorithms and waveform designs, it is best to leverage Xiufeng in those positions.  Once an initial radar framework is in place, perception infrastructure or vehicular infrastructure should take ownership so that Xiufeng can work on radar tracking and fusion issues.",,,Duc Vu,dvu@argo.ai,Xiufeng Song,xsong@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Since it gets clearer for how the radar perception will continue from now on, there needs to be more communications within the radar perception team, to better plan for the sprints and catch up with the timelines. 

Radar perception team needs to better communication with rest of the tracking/prediction team. Hopefully radar team can be proactive instead of being passive. In addition to adding radar's complementary functionalities to the existing pipeline, we need to convince the team the necessity of developing the radar-only module.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Xudong is a valuable technical designer/lead in the design of ARGO detectors. 
He led the team effort in the design of the 128x32  arrays with integrated resistors and the 512x2 GmAPD (CDD). He held the design reviews for both of these projects. He also defined the epitaxial growth and diffusion strategies for these designs. Reviewed mask designs and provided corrections and/or inputs to the team members. 
My experience with Xudong is that when I ask a question as to how a certain process will affect  the device performance, he takes time out and explains it clearly. He is very willing to discuss process issues in the development of the WPS /mask design and acts as a sounding board if see if I or the team may have missed any details.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"o	Xudong has an impressive knowledge base of fundamental semiconductor device physics as well as all technical topics surrounding the LiDAR system, i.e. optical, mechanical, software etc.   His deep and broad knowledge across the different areas makes him a true asset to the LiDAR group.   Xudong played a highly important role during the design effort of the next generation Geiger-mode 2D PDA's by defining technical design strategies, and providing simulations that were critical to understanding the new device and surrounding components.  The 2D PDA is a high profile, very important component of the LiDAR system. He also possesses a good deal of knowledge on wafer processing, which is also critical to realizing working devices that meet the target design goals.  Xudong is always willing to share his knowledge, is easily approachable, and most importantly, is able to breakdown complicated physics and explain them to the team in a clear understandable manner.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Xudong consistently excels at defining and designing core aspects of the PDA design. He’s known through the company as an expert on device physics, and regularly lays the groundwork for device development through careful planning and modeling. 

Over the past six months, Xudong has proposed and developed the APD020 epitaxial structure, and followed up the design proposal with substantial documentation explaining his rationale in detail. He has also created the first version of the comprehensive design documents (CDDs) for both our 2D PDAs with resistors and 1D PDAs for use with the Argo LiDAR. In defining these first drafts, he set the tone for the remainder of development. After creating the original drafts, he continued their development alongside myself and Krys. He also calculated parasitic capacitances for the 1D designs, a critical step in determining the impact of dielectrics on device performance. 

On a personal level, I should note that he is always available, patient, and reasoned. Much of our work on the PDA requires frequent decision-making, so these qualities are especially valuable to the team’s operation.",,,Brian Piccione,bpiccione@argo.ai,Xudong Jiang,xjiang@argo.ai,Hardware,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"A.	Work on MDA SBIR Phase II program
Completed the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) SBIR Phase II program “Disruptive Improvements in Single-Photon Geiger-mode Avalanche Photodiode (GmAPD) Focal Plane Arrays (FPAs) and Cameras” and submitted the final report. Some of the work performed with the scope of this program are relevant to our current effort and will help the design of auto sensor package that is to be used in Argo Lidars.

B.	Work on wafer epi-structure
(1)	Proposed the APD020 structure that has no epitaxially grown filter layer.  If the improvement on epi quality is significant and the impact on crosstalk is minimal, w/o filter layer structure could become the default structure for fabricating GmAPD arrays used in auto sensors.
(2)	Resolved the doping issue in APD017 with VPEC, and facilitated the proper growth of wafers with APD017 structure at VPEC.
(3)	Summarized the design of APD020 and APD017 into a design document.

Our auto sensor devices fabrication starts with Epi growth, and the above work on resolving Epi issues is fundamental to the success of the GmAPD array and auto Lidar business.

C.	Work on the 128x32 GmAPD arrays with integrated resistors
Play a technical leading role in the design of 128x32 GmAPD arrays with integrated resistors
(1)	Defined the objectives and design strategy, identified the critical steps in device processing.
(2)	Defined  the supercell structure and designed the array device and test devices needed. Subsequently made certain revisions to the supercell structure and array/test devices based on the device group daily discussions.
(3)	Initialized the high level layout (HLL) & wafer processing specifications (WPS), and contributed to their subsequent revisions.
(4)	Worked with fellow team members on implementing the designs into mask layout, performed careful reviews on mask layout files and provided critical inputs to the mask layout revisions.
(5)	Defined the diffusion strategy for this wafer run and implemented it with VPEC/GCS.
(6)	Drafted the testing plan and have started to work with other team members on its implementation.
(7)	Completed the sections of “Objectives and Motivations” and “Design Strategy” in the design summary file.

The purpose of carrying out this wafer run is to try to resolve the optical overload issue that GmAPD sensors/cameras encounter by implementing a monolithically integrated thin film resistor in each pixel device. During the process of device design, we learned various trade-offs. The lessons we learned during the design work and the testing results from this wafer run will be implemented in the design work of auto sensors. 

D.	Work on the 512x2 GmAPD array devices
Play a technical leading role in the design of 512x2 GmAPD arrays
(1)	Kicked-off the design effort with a brainstorming session and presented some relevant materials, got all stakeholders in the same room and identified the performance requirements for the 512x2 arrays.
(2)	Defined the supercell structure, designed the array device types and test devices needed, and defined the key device design parameters. Identified the major processing steps that are required to process 512x2 arrays. Gave a series of presentations on 512x2 GmAPD array device design at the daily device design meetings. Revised the supercell structure and array/test devices based on subsequent discussions with device group members and members of other groups.
(3)	Investigated some important performance issues, such as the temperature behavior of device GM performance and the impact of various designs on parasitic capacitances.
(4)	Initialized the comprehensive design document (CDD) and contribute to its subsequent revisions.
(5)	Drafted the testing plan and have started to work with other team members on its implementation.
(6)	Completed the sections of “Objectives and Motivations”, “Design Strategy” and “Testing Plan” in the design summary file.
(7)	Have been working with fellow team members on implementing the designs into layout, perform careful reviews on mask layout files and provide critical inputs on the mask layout revisions.

The goal of this wafer run is to find out optimal array design for auto sensors. The 512x2 arrays are front illuminated (FI) devices which bring a whole set of challenges, such as the mitigation of parasitic capacitances and placement of bonding pads, etc. 

After analyzing the characterization results from the 128x32 GmAPD arrays with integrated resistors and the 512x2 GmAPD array devices, we will come up with an optimal design on high performance auto sensors that will be used in Argo Lidars to be integrated into Argo’s autonomous driving system (ADS). The work described in (C ) and (D) are vital to the success of fabricating high performance Argo Lidars. 

E.	Some additional comments:
I have been working on GmAPD devices/arrays for the past decade and am recognized in the field of single photon detectors. Together with a solid background/training in solid state physics and mathematics, my knowledge/understanding on device and device physics of various photonic and electronic devices (lasers, detectors, transistors, etc.) can contribute broadly to the success of our business, such as:
(1)	Continue to play a key role in detector design.
(2)	Work with Mark Entwistle’s group on various performance issues of FPAs and sensors. 
(3)	Work with Sam Wilton’s group on the system performance issues. Previous collaboration with Sam on Z-score (which provides information about the statistical significance of detection probability compared to a null hypothesis) and my suggestion of using Kalman Filter to handle noise issues are very fruitful. 
(4)	Can participate and contribute to the laser design/performance review and discussions.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"It would be helpful if Xudong were able to contribute more directly to the mask creation process. While he clearly defined many key elements of the designs within our documentation, there was a slowdown in mask creation because the entire mask execution task was split solely between myself and GCS’ CAD engineer. This is something Krys could certainly help with as well, and at some points we were limited by the fact that we had only one copy of our mask CAD tool, L-Edit. Still, I was not using the software all day, and the design process could have been sped up a bit if Xudong was proficient at executing his own designs. 

We’ll save time in future design cycles if the entire PDA team takes the time to learn the new version of L-Edit that’s due to arrive this week. ",,,Brian Piccione,bpiccione@argo.ai,Xudong Jiang,xjiang@argo.ai,Hardware,

Please note, I am including this in all my team peer reviews  since the whole team needs to improve in this aspect:
There are many obstacles in the path of developing the detector. Schedules slip and we, the team, all share responsibility for this. ""Changes "" are presented at the ""11th hour"" and the process design needs to be reviewed and revamped several times and schedules slip. The difficult foundry communication also contributes to the responsibility of this issue. Communication is better, but still a little strained.

 * Identify strengths & interest of each team member and suggest according tasks
 * Develop set of exercises to help teammates to acquire technical skills
 * Form a strong egalitarian engineering culture in the team that is focused on delivering solutions of the highest quality.

There also are a few important technical skills that are missing and have to be learned:
 * Efficient development workflow with kubernetes (telepresence, other tool that speed up and improve dev process)
 * Monitoring and supporting health of distributed system (datadog, prometheus, strategies to gather metrics, defining ""must have"" set of metrics for any service)
 * Automated testing for distributed system which holds a good balance between providing fast & meaningful feedback and efforts to maintain the tests (consumer driven testing)

- Taking time to understand Go's build and directory structure before reaching out for help
- Fully reading through Kubernetes documentation before asking for help. A recent case regarding connecting internal services he asked for help and I pointed him directly to the documentation that gave step by step instructions for achieving his goal.

Yan has also on occasion called a task complete only to find later that it was not working as intended.  For example when originally implemented EFS with Kubernetes to support shared map downloads he thought the project was complete only to find that EFS was not being used and the maps were not being shared.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Ying drove a major feature (base map entity and integration in map server) to code complete on server side. This is a major step stone in easier tracking of map production in map server - this with the log and various pose-related entities would help us answer ""what goes into a map"" programatically. 

Ying also built front end scripts and integrated map publish and ingest into Airflow. This enabled map publishing handoff from LME to LMP. After the handoff, Ying monitored slack channel closely and is fast to respond to any issues. 

Ying is an eager and fast learner. She actively engages subject matter experts and acquires domain knowledge for her tasks. We collaborated on base map, integration scripts, etc and often bounce off ideas. I'd say Ying communicates and collaborates effectively.",,,WeiWei Kang,wkang@argo.ai,Ying Wei,ywei@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Ying's not been here too long, so some of this feedback is likely because she's still on the ramp-up curve.

* Continue ramping up on the Python skills (She's done great, still has a little ways to go).
  - Specifically, the map_tool could probably use more tests and Ying can work on continuing to ramp up on standard python idioms.
* Getting more involved in the code-reviews for parts of the map-server.  Specifically, I think that Ying is now the go-to person for how layers and cities interact with maps but I think that scope will be expanding over the next few months.",,,Matt Gilson,mgilson@argo.ai,Ying Wei,ywei@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"There are certain area of the map production pipeline that I know little of, both within the MAPREP team and Map tool/Labeling team. Knowing the bigger picture can certainly help drive better decisions, although it's impossible to have a perfect design/plan at the first try and as our team and the tools we own grow it'll be harder to know everything, but I certain would like to keep learning.

Working on the map_tools helps me improve my Python skills through feedback (mostly thanks to Matt), looking forward to get better at it.

People outside of MAPREP team don't usually understand how a map is made, as part of the team I'd love to spread that knowledge about what we do and how we do it across the organization.",,,Ying Wei,ywei@argo.ai,Ying Wei,ywei@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Although it is a bit early, the indications are that Ying is pretty good, so it is going to be hard to suggest improvements without sounding picky.  We tend to require peer code reviews on our team before sending pull requests to readers.  She sometimes has a heavy development load and a few times I've gotten reviews a bit later in the day than I wanted (but she doesn't keep me waiting for days).  However, I think that has generally improved. ",,,William Maniatty,wmaniatty@argo.ai,Ying Wei,ywei@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Ying could find opportunities to interact with teams outside MAPREP or LME. This could be helping to answer questions on #map_operations or #log2ply (which she already started doing), or other opportunities.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"I have gained a lot from performance review section in the last cycle. The feedbacks from my colleagues and manager are quite useful and actually aligned well to my self-evaluation. Therefore, the target for this review cycle — aiming for Level 5 SWE has been set since then. I believe most of the goals have been achieved during the past 6 months. This letter is organized as follows: I will first briefly introduce the work I have accomplished during the past 6 months, followed by summary with examples.

**Owner of multiple modules in the perception pipeline. Design and implement each module, regularly improve the scalability, efficiency and/or accuracy.**
- Refactor region of interest partition, ground removal, and segmentation interfaces that can template on different implementations for future scalability.
- Decouple ground removal from segmentation that provides flexibility for different ground removal approaches.
- Improve ROI partition efficiency by constant time querying using rasterized ROI map. 
- Ground removal. Design and implement the ground removal using ground height tile map. This work has greatly improved the accuracy as well as the efficiency of the existing ground removal module, yet it keeps the capability of estimating ground height when ground height layer map is not available. Overall execution time of ROI partition and ground removal has been reduced from over 200ms in the worst case scenario to constant time that is around 10ms.
- Segmentation. Improve the performance efficiency as well as stability. Greatly mitigate the performance bottleneck during the “code red” by reducing segmentation execution speed from up to 300ms down to around 20ms by using “grid based clustering”.

**NDGrid**
- N dimensional Storage class that stores the data.
- N dimensional viewer class that provides non-owning viewing interface to the user defined high dimensional grid space. This viewer class provides various functionalities for querying high dimensional structured data.
- Two dimensional grid resizer. This implementation utilizes Intel IPP library and provides efficient grid resizing functionality.
NDGrid libraries are used in various on-vehicle modules and off-board mapping pipeline. 
- Ground height querying from tile map.
- Grid based segmentation.
- Ground height layer process pipeline.

**Polygon rasterization**
Efficient implementation to rasterize a polygon using edge table. Currently used in ground height layer pipeline, and will be used in rasterized ROI layer pipeline.

**Jump in and help visualization to improve the overall quality during the demo preparation**
- Improve the quality of polygon to cuboid visualization by creating a fusion approach using object heading direction information and minimum bounding rectangle. It yields overall satisfactory results for the demo presentation.
- Replaced draw-on-the-fly speedometer with a pre-rendered version that is more close to a real speedometer. Improve the visual effect by utilizing various image processing techniques such as alpha matting, and image segmentation.

**Derive, design and implement first version of point cloud segmentation benchmark metric library** 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ItvJNYrS__biDO8i22CSj2wubTmolvxCXFmOsGf1qtE/edit#
Currently this is the core library to test how good a segmentation algorithm is. It evaluates the segmentation by conventional score (recall and precision), as well as a novel error metric that specifically models the over-segmentation and under-segmentation error. This design and implementation is the base of a later adapted version 2. And I’m still supporting for any future improvement.

**Derive, design implement camera-LiDAR synchronization algorithm**
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TTKCKkuK_wqApQ2ICDcxZva4b86evly43c78kcKhUQA/edit
The early synchronization did not consider the sampling rate difference between camera (30Hz) and LiDAR (10Hz), and will only match the image/detection bbox to the end of a LiDAR sweep. This proposed algorithm pre-computes the time offset b/w a LiDAR scan begin and LiDAR intersecting a camera’s FOV, given intrinsics and extrinsics of camera and LiDAR. This “calibration” algorithm is currently used in camera/LiDAR labelling tool, and can be easily incorporated in any camera-LiDAR fusion perception algorithm.

**Ground height query from tile map**
- Quickly implemented an initial version of ground height query using tile map for the March demo. Now it is being used by both tracking and visualization.
- Improve the efficiency of the ground height querying by converting double precision in the city map coordinate to single float precision in local translation only coordinate. This optimization improves the querying efficiency by approximately 10%.
- Apply a post-process step in the map loading stage that incorporates the rasterized ROI. Hence enabling ROI+Ground removal in a single step.

**Ground height tile map pipeline**
https://docs.google.com/document/d/10k-DxCnZUmIdifYf2OWH-hRT3Zm8mS5M5tvoI914jr8/edit
- Design and implemented the pipeline, which consists: 
	a. ground height hole filling. 
	b. ground height resampling and interpolation. 
	c. and rasterized ROI intersection.
- Create python tools for easy map building incorporation, and coordinate with MAPREP team to roll out this new layer in the near future.


I enjoy coming up with new ideas and turning some of them into engineering products. Equipped along with solid software skills, this skillset has enabled me driving perception projects that involve algorithm design, software architecting, as well as efficient implementation.

At least three sub-modules should be included in ground height tile map pipeline during the map build. Each of them has at least one aspect that I enjoy. Hole filling requires careful algorithm derivation—a simple median filter or Gaussian low pass filter can yield erroneous results when local ground is not flat, yet complicated 3D plane estimation has the trade-off in speed. A directional de-correlated approach that exploits first order derivatives, along with local weighted average estimation has emerged, and it gives smooth ground height estimation. And with efficient execution, thanks to the de-coupled first order approximation, enabling filling all the holes within minutes given a large Pittsburgh map. ROI rasterization with polygon scan conversion is a good example for efficient software implementation. Closely working with mapping team, I’m excited to have our new on-vehicle ROI/ground height layer. The next excited work I’m looking forward to is ground height compression. They all align well to my image/signal processing and statistics background, and software engineering skills that I’ve been endlessly seeking improvements.

Academic experience in camera pipeline and geometric computer vision gives me extensive knowledge in camera space. Engineering research and practice in LiDAR sensor has just given me more ammunition to solve complicated multi-modal problems. Camera-LiDAR synchronization is yet another interesting project. Starting from scratch, deriving LiDAR intersecting with camera FOV (model as a frustum) was pretty fun. With sufficient and valid assumptions, these time offsets can be pre-computed. This actually gives us much better synchronized image/detection bounding boxes, and should benefit to future fusion algorithms. Looking further, I’m also interested in extracting partial LiDAR sweep that matches a detection bounding box’s frustum, therefore all LiDAR point cloud can be motion compensated to the middle of corresponding camera’s exposure time (at least can be used in offline labeling tool). My background in camera pipeline and geometric computer vision can also be contributing to these cool stuffs.

Improving point cloud segmentation efficiency, yet with small trade-off in accuracy within one day has been one of my favorites during “code-red”. By digging into details and analyzing bottlenecks, I just realized a rasterization with sparse data structure could be the solution. The actual implementation did not take long because most of the required libraries (NDGrid, DBSCAN, etc.) are already there. And the results look satisfactory, thanks to Dongran’s binary search style parameters tuning. Yet, this algorithm is not even close to perfect. I look forward to working with detection team to incorporate more semantic information, and boost the segmentation performance to the next level.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"As soon as Yue started in Argo he began working on new features for the simulation.   He immediately began work on the simulation of Traffic Lights and continues to add features to Traffic lights.  These include the implementation of a standalone traffic light task, integrating of traffic lights into the simulation framework and updating the traffic light components to provide a default setting for undefined lights.   Yue continues his work with traffic lights to infer the traffic light grouping and behavior for intersections using the limited information defined in the map.

Yue's work with scenario generation scripts also provides a simple way to quickly create a simulation scenario by modifying  a small subset of parameters.  

Yue worked with multiple teams to generate the first round of evaluation metrics used in the simualtion cloud nightly regression tests.   Those metrics are used to evaluate and detect regressions in MP, MC, and Sim.

Yue has provided valuable feedback in design discussions.  Yue's perspective on mover intersection behavior influenced the current design and the design of improved mover behavior.",,,Tom Ackenhausen,tackenhausen@argo.ai,Yue Han,yhan@argo.ai,Software,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"- Metrics on AFDF framework
Yue was a key developer on the AFDF metrics working collaboratively with MC.  This analysis is vital with the growing codebase in order to make sure new features and code changes do not cause regression in AV behavior.

- Implemented SurrogateTrafficLight code
Yue was the lead member on the SimEng team to setup code related to Traffic Lights. This code needed to integrate with how MP viewed Traffic Lights appropriately, as well as having the ability to be configured in simulations to test specific MP/MC/AI/Prediction problems. This problem was largely undefined and Yue took responsibility to outline how these processes would work and more recently developed code to give default traffic light configurations for any map (where previously we needed to do manual setup of Traffic Lights).

Yue takes on and completes challenging assignments with minimal supervision. All of my interactions with Yue have been positive and I look forward to working more with him in the future.",,,Michael Nayhouse,mnayhouse@argo.ai,Yue Han,yhan@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Yue has made multiple contributions to the Argo Data Analysis Framework (ADAF). He was one of the first developers outside of the Motion Control (MC) team to contribute to it. I worked with him closely to help him land code for simulation mileage accumulation metrics, simulation static obstacle clearance metrics as well as dynamics obstacle distances. He has made a lot of contributions that benefit his team (sim eng.). Yue has also made contributions to core ADAF functionality such as reading data from the log config blob to acquire information helpful to Motion Planning (MP) metrics. And he has also made contribution to ADAF that support MP metrics regarding the trajectory message, specifically trajectory validity. 

In general Yue was a solid contributor to data analysis and the metrics framework for sim. He has substantially grown his python skills and quickly adopted the Argo python coding standard. Yue has also made concerted effort this last cycle to learn more about the system that we have from a MC/MP and sim perspective. Given that his background is not in robotics I think he has greatly grown his knowledge of the system, which has allowed him to be a solid individual contributor.  

Yue's core strength from my perspective is that he has good software practices and programming experience. This makes him a very good asset to the simulation team specifically and the org in general. More recently he has provided me with some scripts that he created early on to set traffic light states for simulation scenarios. I was not involved in developing them, but as a user I could tell that they were designed by a developer who has good software engineering skills. I am very excited to see what new projects Yue takes on and what new contributions he will make to the sim team as well as ADAF. ",,,Gus Atmeh,gatmeh@argo.ai,Yue Han,yhan@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Yue has the skills needed to make a contribution to a project, but I think he can grow his skill in owning a problem and solving it regardless of its source. One example I remember was when he was working on developing an analysis module for ADAF and ran into an issue with writing unit tests. The problem was that currently the CI framework does not allow loading shared libraries in python, and he was using a shared library to read messages from a log. So when he imported it for a unit test to make synthetic data CI would fail. Instead of owning the problem and having a workaround such as making his own data structures for the time being to allow him to write unit tests, he decided to only make a ticket on the INF jira board and did not have any unit tests in his PR. This is something I think that if Yue worked on improving it would allow him to have a larger impact at Argo. 

I also encourage Yue to grow his leadership skills and lead by example. I have noticed that he tends to err on the side of making suggestions when in a meeting or discussion rather than trying to make a point or taking initiative to lead the discussion or project.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Yue has extensive C++ knowledge and design experience.  He should feel free to analyze the current simulation designs and offer critiques and suggestions for improvements.  The simulation team can benefit from any additional perspective and thoughts on design.

Yue is new to autonomous vehicles and can grow by continuing to learn the AV components such as sensing, perception, localization,  to the MP/MC stack and their interactions with the vehicle platform.

Yue could also improve by landing features in smaller sub components.  Much of it is due to the nature of the feature, but pushing smaller components can lead to faster reviews and design feedback.",,,Tom Ackenhausen,tackenhausen@argo.ai,Yue Han,yhan@argo.ai,Software,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"Specific accomplishments, projects, and results that I drove during the review cycle timeframe:

I joined Argo AI on Sept 1, 2017. I am very motivated by the vision of Argo, and I feel that the past 9 months are the most productive period in my career. Here is a list of things I have done:

1. Designed and built the first version of the log processing pipeline that converts raw logs into searchable Parquet logs. Fort the design, I thoroughly evaluated several different approaches by implementing all of them and running experiments, and chose the best performing and scalable approach. 
2. Configured Zeppelin notebook as an ad-hoc log search interface and wrote log search demo scripts.
3. Led the Data Core team to harden the log processing pipeline by adding ElasticSearch logging, Datadog metrics and dashboards.
4. Designed and implemented a Spark-based camera image keyframe extractor that extracts JPEG images from raw logs at 2 Hz. It is scalable enough to run on all logs.
5. In collaboration with INF team, designed and implemented batch video decompression Spark job that decompresses full res video once they are uploaded to s3.
6. In collaboration with VCI team, designed and led the implementation of event-based log filtering system that saves about 35% - 50% of upload bandwidth.
7. Lead the effort of rolling out dropped message finder in two days. This tool allows us to see what and how many messages are missing in the logs based on message sequence number. I contributed the core Spark-based algorithm for it and figured out a hacky way to make it run fast.  
8. In collaboration with MAPPING team, implemented an automated notifier that sends a Slack notification when mapping run log is ingested and also triggers a log validation Airflow workflow.  
9. Led the project for improving log finder performance. 
10. Mostly recently, I rolled out an improved/streamlined log processing pipeline that cuts down Parquet conversion time from 10 hours on average to 2-3 hours on average. 
11. In collaboration with David Lenkner, I helped to automate the log glancer zeppelin notebook using a Luigi workflow that processes Parquet logs.  
12. Mentored new DC team members to bring them up to speed
13. Helped engineers in other teams with their SparkSQL/Parquet/Zeppelin related questions, e.g. David Lenkner, Claire Wu and Dave Swanky to name a few. 


Also, I took ownership of the log processing pipeline, checked on its health on a daily basis, and quickly responded to issues and potential issues found (e.g. diagnostics channel blowing up ingest cluster).


Areas where I have grown and made improvements:

I'd say my C++ skills improved significantly (well, my based line was low). Before joining Argo, the last time I wrote C++ code was in 2004. Now I am enjoying the new features in C++11/14 such as RVO, move semantics, uniform initialization, and smart pointers. 


Specific examples regarding demonstrated sustained performance at the next level:

Tech leadership:
1) I designed the log processing pipeline from ground up. When I joined Argo in Sept 2017, no one else at Argo knew what Parquet was. I talked to teams that consumes logs, including Infrastructure, Perception, Motion Planning, Motion Control, Map and labeling, Performance Analysis to understand their use case, and designed the schema for Parquet logs that is currently in use today. With the goal in mind, I envisioned the need for a log processing workflow that converts raw logs into Parquet data. Working in a self-direct way, I decomposed the workflow into two steps and built POCs for each step quickly. There were lots of design decisions of each step. I based the design decisions on experiment results, which stroke a balance between performance and utility. The resulting pipeline processes 100 - 150 TB of raw logs per day on small clusters.   
2) Tech lead of the Data Core team
3) Provides subject matter expertise on log analysis/search using Spark RDD API and SparkSQL.

Team work: 
1) I was the key influencer that changed the initial design of onboard video compression data format so that video decompression is seamless and scalable. 
2) Event-based log filtering design discussions. I'd say it is an example of ""ultimately finding a decision that balances all of considerations in play, able to achieve team buy-in without drama""  

Communication:
1) Wrote and commented on many design documents
2) Email communication of key features and issues to software team
3) Presented designs to managers and leadership
4) Regularly interacts with cross-functional peers.

Concrete examples regarding impact on company and team goals:
1) Parquet logs are getting wide-spread usage across the company. Concrete examples: Log glance notebook, INF team using it to narrow down on CPU overheat problem quickly, Perception team using it to gather metrics on tracks messages, etc
2) Event based log filtering saves 35% - 50% upload bandwidth.

How long has sustained performance been demonstrated: 9 months",,,Yuhang Wang,ywang@argo.ai,Yuhang Wang,ywang@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Specific accomplishments Yuhang drove during this review cycle include:

Design and Built the first(and current) version of our off-board log processing pipeline. This pipeline takes our raw on vehicle format and parses this in to parquet logs. These are much more efficient for general queries and searching. 

Implemented / Configured Zepplin log search pipeline and generated documentation & training on using pyspark to do efficient log queries. 

yuhang worked with my team directly to implement a spark based camera decompression pipeline that extracts JPEG images from losslessly compressed H265 compress camera data from the vehicles. He worked closely to influence the technical direction of this pipeline.

Yuhang worked with my team to design and implement a ingest based log slicing job that allowed us to reduce data offload by 35-50%. This allowed the VCI team to focus their efforts on other piecees of the vehicle software stack, and push event based logging on vehicle.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Yuhang has designed and implemented some core tools and infrastructure that is critical to triage and performance analysis, as well as other offboard processes.  He supports this infrastructure very well, a testament to good initial design.  Specifics on high positive impacts I have seen directly from Yuhang -

1  The Performance Analysis pipeline is by and large reliant on the Parquet distributed data system that he has set up.  He's been responsive supporting the very large data sizes involved, as well as keeping up with changing data formats, and requests for help with specific channels in that data.  This provides a critical link in the pipeline of triage operations (mpriest team) as well as PA dashboards, and log-searching tools used company-wide.

2 - assisting with other pipeline utilities further down the chain than Parquet, e.g. the new ""OneRelease"" log glance Zeppelin notebook I have been working on is fully based on the Parquet-format data store, and runs in the Zeppelin environment that is part of his Ambari cluster setup.

3 - quickly putting out fires with ingest, upload, processing, and in that first-responder role helping uncover at least one serious on-vehicle issue, e.g. the issue in the Diagnostics logger which accidentally logged a huge amount of duplicate data",,,David Lenkner,dlenkner@argo.ai,Yuhang Wang,ywang@argo.ai,Software,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,My primary interaction with Yuhang during this review cycle was in regards to the Parquet log search system he implemented.  In addition to providing direction on how to leverage the Parquet and Zeppelin he has already been very eager to help extend them in order to assist us with whatever issues we were tackling.  One excellent example was the work he undertook to help evaluate logs for missing frames.  This provided additional information which ultimately led to the discovery of another log issue where messages were actually far more out of order then expected.  Another example was building atop of his log annotation parsing solution to notify us when mapping or labeling logs were being ingested.  In both cases he produced solutions quite quickly.,,,Tyler Krampe,krampe@argo.ai,Yuhang Wang,ywang@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"I had the pleasure to work with Yuhang on an effort to enable video compression on vehicle. He set up a cluster of nodes to perform video decompression on s3 using tools developed by infrastructure team. It has been working reliably decompressing hundreds of logs daily and little issues have seen so far.
Yuhang was able to identify AWS S3 hash issue and worked with infrastructure to fix it. 
I am very impressed by Yuhang's domain knowledge and the quality of work he delivers. He takes ownership of the work and communicates to INF team with any issue seen in a timely fashion.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Taking Yuhang's own suggested focus area for growth around people skills, I might suggest for cross team interactions.  He has taken point on standing up a few fantastic solutions and as stated within the 'Accomplishments and Strengths' section he has done a great job at extending to help teams like Labeling and Mapping.  Some aspects of these solutions may have provided even greater benefit initially with a deeper understanding of how other teams could/would take advantage of the solution from the start.  This could be in the form of obtaining a greater understanding of what other teams are doing and how they are doing it, or with more cross team information and requirements gathering at the outset of the design.",,,Tyler Krampe,krampe@argo.ai,Yuhang Wang,ywang@argo.ai,Software,

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"I think two areas yuhang can work to improve on are communication and leadership. Yuhang is clearly an expert in his domain, and should strive to effectively communicate not only the great work he is doing, but the technical tradeoffs that are being made when working an broad reaching projects. I think in general the parquet log search capabilities when initially implemented could have been more effectively communicated to the organization. Emails/Formal Trainings for big projects like this can be especially effective. Leadership cuts closely with communication. Focus on not only asserting your technical expertise, but focus on how that message is conveyed(particularly to more junior staff). One example of when this could have been handled more effectively was when we were initially building out the parquet pipeline, you and a junior engineer on the team had a technical disagreement on which underlying technology we should use to scale up the parquet pipeline. I think this was a missed opportunity to teach why your design was actually superior given the near term tradoffs(we didn't have anything stood up).

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Zack has been just an incredible asset to this recruiting team.  I have now been working with him directly for the last 14+ months as we got this whole recruiting function set up.  I have seen Zack take on more and more responsibility during that time.  
He has been indirectly leading the entire software recruiting team and helped provide guidance, mentorship and process improvement to Jeremy, Tina and CG at various times in the the recruiting function.  He of course did all of this while also carrying and handling several of his own requirements from L3 to L7+.  He has helped close candidates out and provided guidance to help sell candidates on Argo.
Zack pushes back on his managers/clients during the interview process and holds his ground when trying to help establish if candidates are the right fit in feedback sessions.  He speaks with conviction about Argo and the direction that this company is headed.  
He has set up multiple sourcing session to focus on team specific needs and a monthly sourcing session focused on diversity.
He worked with Jenn and Kyle to help wrangle in the headcount concern going into 2018 and was able to help work to establish a way to track it all.  
Zack has also worked with and helped to run the SWAG shop for all internal swag as well as those needed for conferences and company events and continues to provide his time here.
He helped with intern sourcing this year, provide a great referral that was offered a role and has helped set up the swag for those coming in.  
Zack embraces and is what Argo is and what Argo will become.  He hold his own values as high as he holds the culture and values of this company and with that, only looks to bring on the best possible candidates to join the team.

First, Zack organized and lead sourcing sessions for my teams  which was particularly helpful as both Niko and Mike were new to the hiring manager role. This allowed us to better identify candidates for both RAD as well as Core. We recently hired(offer accepted) an L5 candidate for the core team as a result of these efforts.

Second, Zack helped me personally craft job descriptions that were much more focused and targeted on what we actually needed to hire. Previously we had very general job descriptions, creating more focused descriptions has allowed us to get higher quality candidates int he pipeline. This means the engineering team spends less time wasting time on candidates that aren't right for our positions.

Finally, Zack is extremely strong in providing mentorship/guidance on leveling and compensation for candidates.  With a recent candidate we were looking at closing, we had a conversation on compensation and he ensured me that we could close with roughly 10% lower salary than I originally suggested. This allowed the organization to add a high quality candidate at a great value.

	-recognition of HM's valued time and knowing appropriate times to push versus be patient
	-providing constant feedback and constructive criticism to peers
	-serving as a mentor to team members while maintaining responsibilities of individual contribution

*Collaboration

In the world of recruiting it's imperative to collaborate well not only within the recruiting team but across all teams - I feel I've demonstrated success in this area. I'm given the opportunity to work with various teams on a regular basis. It's one of my favorite parts about my work. I enjoy seeing and being involved in the many different pieces of what's happening here at Argo and interacting with the multitude of different team members. I feel there is great value in having a pulse on the surroundings of other teams and what they have going on.

*Sustained performance

-have become the go to for many HM's I'm not directly partnered with
-mentor and aid recruiters with decisions in which guidance is required
-provide greenlight on decisions for specific approach to candidates and sourcing techniques
-constant dedication to precision
-hold weekly 1:1's with HM's; often join other recruiter's 1:1's with HM's when there are hiring hurdles to provide guidance
-represent Argo to the best of my ability at all times through every interaction and communication
-good instinct toward potential hurdles in regard to process
-find solutions to get solidified process versus patching things on case by case basis
-maintain a pulse on software as a whole beyond the needs of my dedicated HM's to help forecast and preemptively build pipelines

-help to raise the bar of Level we're hiring for
-make myself available to colleagues and candidates beyond typical work hours
-lead specific sourcing sessions to help hit team OKR's

I feel I have the full trust of others on the team when speaking and providing ideas and opinions. Over the past few months I feel like I was regularly relied upon as the go to for suggesting allocation based on the recognition of particular skills sets and other variables in candidates. I've helped provide a couple of the team's target OKR's and helped hit those OKR's through both individual performance and driving certain targets through mentorship.

I want Zack to become more proactive and not so reactive.  If he can get ahead of what is potentially coming in from his managers or even in his own daily tasks, he will be that much better of a recruiter.

Zack has great experience and if he knows that a new approach or idea will not work or could be super successful...share with us.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,self,"From Sep 2017 to Mar 2018, I have lead the development the first version of Argo's triage application and successfully delivered it. It brought in a great value to Argo as it fills up the gap of triaging AV software defect in house and closed the loop back of AV software development lifecycle. Triaging one event used to take 30 mins to 3 hours, and on triage app users can triage 200 events per day. 

It was very tough to start with as it was a ground-breaking. Nobody at Argo has built such a tool before. The targeted user team has not been staffed yet. There was no underlying tools ready to use directly. My team including myself had different background skills. 
But I faced the big challenges directly, and tried all possible ways to identify a path and push forward. As the first hire of this team in Sep, I start digging all possibly related docs, emails, slack messages, etc., and found all possibly relevant person and try to communicate with them. The examples include the infra, mapping, tracking, viz, vehicle ops teams etc. Even thought nobody knows what is a triage app but putting together various disparate inputs helped me shaping up a good overall picture. 
In Oct, I created an MVP overnight, and presented to the leadership who had prior experience and seek for alignment towards their strategic vision. The main value was to boost the efficiency of AV event triage, and the high-level design was Web UI + video generation pipeline (from vehicle logs) on cloud. All were blessed by leaders. 
In Nov, I started the technical design in parallel with team construction. Eventually, I built up a team of five engineers from scratch and established a good team work atmosphere and put together five individual strangers into one unified team force. As the team expanded, in Dec I created a project plan and OKRs for each quarter and did proper allocation to each individuals, which took into account of each individual's background and preference.
The design was not easy as the team and myself had to learn the relevant technologies along with the way. The time pressure to deliver the product was very high and I worked hard along with the team to learn from failures and iterate quickly. 
I also established the process of weekly sprint planning/retrospective, daily standup, jira ticket, team slack channel etc to better organize the team effort. 

Along the way, I did my best to quickly adapt the changes from dependent parties. 
A new team of triage ops got established, and I quickly established a communication channel with them and establish a list of feature requests from the main user. 
The underlying tooling also kept evolving into different behaviors. I closely monitored the changes, communicated to the counter parties, adjusted and aligned our roadmap with theirs. 
In March, there was a change on the strategic vision, from efficiency to versatility. Hence the entire backend had to change from video generation pipeline to VNC cloud hosting. It's a big change and meant trashing away a lot of our work. I tried hard to comfort the team and convince them it's the right strategic call for the company and we should adjust to it for the general benefit. The momentum was kept well and we continued to integrate triage web well with the new VNC backend. 

In Jan, I represented our team and attended the software team's annual planning. I actively participated in the workshops and discussions. For example, I added my voice on the topic that our AV software development missed a big piece, which was the functional test to close the loop. 

In Feb, there was an organizational change and all my team was moved to Lee's org. There were concerns among the team members about the future and impact to their career. I worked closely with Lee and pass along positive messages to each team member and ensure it's a better alignment for the company as well as their career growth.

Another project happened in parallel at Jan ~ Mar 2018, which was the analytics platform. I drafted the high-level architectural design and presented to the audience company-wise. I started the trade study among several candidate tools, by establishing communications with a few vendors, watching their demos and discuss about our specific feature requirements, and conducting in-house trial of their products. The effort was paused as I was switched to the next project.  

Since end of Mar 2018, I was switched to lead the development effort on the project of Jobs Platform.  
At the new org, I was needed to shift my focus from management to development. Under Lee's help, I adjusted to the new role quickly and started to make contributions on the new track. Within 2 sprints, I implemented the job status feature of Jobs Platform, which received positive recognition from end users as they could have insight on failed jobs now, instead of waiting for 3 hours for our engineers to pull out the error logs for them.
I created the roadmap of JP in Q2, and actively participated in the designs and communications with various collaborating teams and align the overall roadmap and progress and make sure the end user's issues/features are tackled in time.
I organized the team processes on weekly sprint planning/retrospective, daily standup, jira ticket, team slack channel etc to put the new formed team together.

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"- Zhi led the Triage team to successfully deliver - Triage Web application, ETL, video generation pipeline. The team had to build all these components from scratch with a vague set of requirements. Zhi helped the team to focus on defining meaningful milestones and helped them prioritize their tasks in order to deliver on time.

- Zhi's good organizational skills and his ability to have constant dialogue with potential users of the s/w products he owns, makes him very suitable for project management. Triage team was happy to leverage his project management skills to be able to organize their priorities. 

- He was very patient & supportive and let me and Cindy buy more time to tackle some of the hard problems related to the video generation pipeline. He always wanted us to do the right thing and did not want us to resort to hacky way of building things. 

- Zhi's technical contributions have mostly been in the areas of building few parts of Triage ETL, analytics & reporting, DB schema design. 

- He is very approachable and does his best to collaborate with this team. He has good communication skills and he clearly sets his expectations while leading a project.",,,Shreyas Nagaraj,snagaraj@argo.ai,Zhi Lin,zlin@argo.ai,Software,
Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"I've been working with Zhi for a past few months on jobs platform project.

Zhi took ownership of communication with product users and managing leadership expectation and provided valuable contribution in these areas: he prepared and presented jobs platform to end users during team trip to Pittsburgh, helped with communication with sim and resim teams to support their use cases and overall with users who would like to use jp. He also created detailed Q2 plan for the project and took responsibility in managing agile board.

In addition to that he also contributed to product: improved error reporting, migrated users to a new kubernetes cluster and addressed a few issues that appeared during this migration.",,,Yan Babitski,ybabitski@argo.ai,Zhi Lin,zlin@argo.ai,Software,

Accomplishments & Strengths ,peer,"Zhi was my tech lead for building out the Triage web application. I worked closely with him to build out this application from November 2017 until April 2018. During those months Zhi supplied a good amount of guidance as to the high level features and deliverables which would be valuable to the organization. The majority of these features turned out to be successful and the application overall proved to be very valuable to the org.

While guiding the team on which features to build, and how to prioritize features, he gave me and my teammates a good amount of freedom to design and build the features with a good amount of freedom and self direction. This made working on the application more rewarding. He also worked to align members of the team so that people could spend the most time working on areas that they had expressed interest.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"While working with Zhi on the Triage web application, there was a lot of effort by two team members spent working on productizing the video encoding pipeline. Eventually this feature ended up getting cut because the customer decided this feature was not useful for them. Earlier interfacing and feedback might have reduced investment in this area.",,,Mark Shamis,mshamis@argo.ai,Zhi Lin,zlin@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,self,"I could have done a better job on establishing a closer communication channel with the leadership, where I can provide more accurate timely feedback and hear their strategic inputs/changes. The work at Argo is very dynamic and many good features were coming from our leader's vision. Even though geo distance is a factor, this is still something I should improve to eliminate miscommunication regardless. I felt the situation already improved after switching to the new org, having my manager and TPM located at Pittsburgh office as well.

I also can improve myself on doing more coding work and expand my technical knowledge base. This could help me get better insight of technical details and make better technical decisions. Also, my coding work could directly contribute and accelerate our team's delivery. My manager has already started helping me by reducing managerial distraction so I could spend more time to focus on coding.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"As a tech lead, Zhi can demonstrate more technical leadership in introducing new frameworks, infrastructures or industry recommended best practices to job platform team to enhance the team technical strength and establish team core competency.

Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"Product that our team is building - jobs platform - is an emerging product. Being at this stage of development it is hard to make plans regarding what should be happening - too many things are unknown. Given that I believe it might make some sense to pay less attention to being precise in planning.

Additionally I don't have clarity regarding ""leadership"" role in project. Zhi definitely provides a lot of value in communication area but ""tech lead"" role in my opinion requires higher level of technical seniority: experience dealing with technical issues, designing systems, experimenting with different approaches and so on.",,,Yan Babitski,ybabitski@argo.ai,Zhi Lin,zlin@argo.ai,Software,
Areas of Growth & Improvement ,peer,"- Zhi is very strong when it comes project management, but I guess that takes away bulk of his time since he is very diligent and ensures the team is heading in the right path. However, I feel he could start making more time to be more ""hands on"". This will help the team to deliver faster and leverage his experience in making better technical decisions.

- He seems to have a good background in big data systems, data analytics. But, the off-board software teams like Jobs platform are much more than that. There are other arenas like AV domain specific stuff, infrastructure etc) which he needs to focus and get a strong hold on, in order to be in a better position to manage and guide the engineering teams well.
